When designing applets it is important to allow (as much as possible) for all students to access them.

:toc:

== Fontsize, Color & Contrast

Using large fonts with a good contrast is important. Select a large font-size in Options -> Fontsize before you start
designing your applet. You can also use the keyboard shortcut [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#2# to make all fonts bigger and
all lines thicker. [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#3# will change the default for all new objects to be Black and unfilled.

Ideally use dark colors on a white background and thick lines. Pure
https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=FF0000,bg=FFFFFF[Red] and
https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=00FF00,bg=FFFFFF[Green] don't have a very good contrast so you
should use some darker versions, eg https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=0000FF,bg=FFFFFF[Blue],
https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=226600,bg=FFFFFF[Dark Green],
https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=990033,bg=FFFFFF[Dark Red]

If you use colors to distinguish otherwise-similar objects, then consider also using dashed lines for one of them. You
can also find websites where you can check whether your color scheme is good, for example https://www.vischeck.com/

== Sliders

Make sliders as long as possible so that they are usable by students whose fine motor-skills are less good. Consider
adding "decrement" and "increment" Buttons at each end of the slider as well.

== Keyboard Shortcuts

Students can use [.kcode]#Tab# to cycle round the objects in a worksheet you have designed. It is important that you
*uncheck "Selection Allowed"* in Object Properties -> Advanced for the objects you don't want to be selected. There is a
keyboard shortcut [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#Shift# + [.kcode]#D# in the desktop version that will toggle this property
for objects *other than* Buttons / Sliders / Checkboxes / Points / Input Boxes.

The arrow keys [.kcode]#Left#, [.kcode]#Right#, [.kcode]#Up#, [.kcode]#Down# can be used to move Sliders and Points once
they are selected.

[.kcode]#Space# can be used to activate a Button, toggle a Checkbox or start/stop a slider animating

[.kcode]#Escape# can be used to leave a worksheet and [.kcode]#Enter# to go back in (useful if you have several GeoGebra
worksheets on one page)

[.kcode]#+# and [.kcode]#âˆ’# can be used to move a point on a path (eg on a circle)

GeoGebra Applets are also fully touch-enabled so students can use applets on a special large tablet if necessary.

== Tooltips

You can provide custom tooltips for certain objects by using the _Caption_ property, and changing how the tooltip is
shown: xref:/Tooltips.adoc[Tooltips]

== Screen Readers

You can have some text attached to the Graphics Views so that it is read by a screen reader.

If you make a text object in GeoGebra called `++altText++`, `++altText2++`, `++altText3D++` then it will be attached to
Graphics View 1, Graphics View 2, Graphics View 3D respectively.
