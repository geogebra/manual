= Functions

To enter a function you can use previously defined variables (e.g. numbers, points, vectors) as well as other functions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* Function f: `++f(x) = 3 x^3 – x^2++`
* Function g: `++g(x) = tan(f(x))++`
* Nameless function: `++sin(3 x) + tan(x)++`

====

[NOTE]
====

All available predefined functions (e.g. sin, cos, tan) are described in section
xref:/Predefined_Functions_and_Operators.adoc[Predefined Functions and Operators].

====

In GeoGebra you can also use commands to get for example, the xref:/commands/Integral.adoc[integral] and
xref:/commands/Derivative.adoc[derivative] of a function. You can use xref:/commands/If.adoc[If Command] to get
xref:/Conditional_Functions.adoc[Conditional Functions].

[NOTE]
====

You can also use the commands f'(x) or f''(x), … in order to get the derivatives of a previously defined function f(x).

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

Define function _f_ as `++f(x) = 3 x^3 – x^2++`. Then, you can type in `++g(x) = cos(f' (x + 2))++` in order to get
function _g_.

====

Furthermore, functions can be translated by a vector (see xref:/commands/Translate.adoc[Translate Command]) and a free
function can be moved by using the image:22px-Mode_move.svg.png[Mode
move.svg,width=22,height=22]xref:/tools/Move.adoc[Move Tool]. Other
xref:/commands/Transformation_Commands.adoc[Transformation Commands] can be also applied to functions, but in most cases
the result is not a function but a curve.

== Limit Function to Interval

In order to limit a function to an interval [a, b], you need to use the xref:/commands/Function.adoc[Function Command]
or the xref:/commands/If.adoc[If Command].

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++If[3<=x<=5,x^2]++` and `++Function[x^2,3,5]++` both define a function _x^2^_ restricted to interval [3,5]
