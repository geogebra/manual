= Object Position
:page-en: Object_Position
ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

Position of objects can be specified in the Position tab of xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties Dialog].

* For vectors, the position is specified by the start point.
* For images, the position is specified by one, two or three corners (see xref:./tools/Image.adoc[Image properties] for
details.)

Position of images and sliders may be fixed with respect to screen. This feature is by default enabled for sliders and
disabled for images. To change it, switch _Absolute Position On Screen_ in the Position Tab of
xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties Dialog]. The xref:/Action_Objects.adoc[Action Objects] have always absolute
position on screen.
