= Texts

Text objects can be easily created using xref:/commands/Text_Command.adoc[Text Command] or
image:24px-Mode_text.svg.png[Mode text.svg,width=24,height=24] xref:/tools/Insert_Text_Tool.adoc[Insert Text Tool], or
by dragging an object from the image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view algebra.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/Algebra_View.adoc[Algebra View] to the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View]. Another way *for advanced users* (described
below) is typing into xref:/Input_Bar.adoc[Input Bar] directly.

Static text::
  does not depend on any mathematical objects and is usually not affected by changes of the construction.

Dynamic text::
  contains values of objects that automatically adapt to changes made to these objects.

Mixed text::
  is a combination of static and dynamic text. In order to create a mixed text you may enter the static part of the text
  using the keyboard (e.g. Point A =). Then, click on the object whose value you want to display in the dynamic part of
  the text.

== [#Input_via_Input_Bar]#Input via Input Bar#

Texts can also be created using the Input Bar. In this case the syntax, which seperates the dynamic and static parts, is
to be considered.

[NOTE]

====

GeoGebra automatically adds the syntax ("Point A = " + A ) necessary to create your mixed text: quotation marks around
the static part of the text and a plus (+) symbol to connect the different parts of the text.

|Input |Description
|This is static text |Static text
|A |Dynamic text (if point A exists)
|"Point A = " + A |Two-part mixed text using the value of point A
|"a = " + a + "cm" |Three-part mixed text using the value of number a
|===

[NOTE]

====

If an object with the name xx already exists and you want to create a static text using the object’s name, you need to
enter it with quotation marks ("xx"). Otherwise, GeoGebra will automatically create a dynamic text that gives you the
value of object xx instead of its name. However, you can type any text that doesn’t match any existing object’s name
without the quotation marks.

====

[NOTE]

====

Within a mixed text, the static part needs to be in between a pair of quotation marks. Different parts of a text (e.g.
static and dynamic parts) can be connected using plus (+) symbols. Since 4.0, the + symbols are not mandatory.

[NOTE]

====

Text objects can also use xref:/LaTeX.adoc[LaTeX] for typesetting math.
