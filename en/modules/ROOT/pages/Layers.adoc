[NOTE]
====

In GeoGebra, layers are used to determine which object to select or drag when the user clicks on multiple objects at the
same time.

====

By default, all objects are drawn on layer 0, which is basically the background layer of the
image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics
View]. A total of 10 layers are available (numbers 0 to 9) and higher numbered layers are drawn on top of lower numbered
layers.

Using the _Advanced_ tab of the xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties Dialog], you can change the layer for a certain
object (layers from 0 to 9 available). Once you change the layer number for at least one object to be different from
layer 0 (e.g. to layer 3), all new objects will be drawn on the layer with the highest number that is used for any
object.

[NOTE]
====

After selecting any object in the GeoGebra Desktop Version, you can select all objects in the same layer by selecting
item _Select Current Layer_ (keyboard shortcut: [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#L#) from the Edit menu. This menu item is only
available if all selected objects lie on the same layer.

====

== Further use of layers

* For SVG export, objects are grouped by layer.
* Layers can be controlled using the JavaScript Interface for xref:/Export_Worksheet_Dialog.adoc[GeoGebra applets].
