The image:18px-Menu_view_probability.svg.png[Menu view probability.svg,width=18,height=18] _Probability Calculator_ is
one of GeoGebra's main perspectives. You may use it in order to calculate and graph probability distributions, as well
as to conduct statistical tests.

== Distributions

Tab _Distribution_ allows you to graph a variety of probability distributions. Just select the distribution you want to
work with from the list available in the drop down menu (e.g. Normal, Binomial) and GeoGebra will graph it for you.
Then, you may adjust the parameters of the distribution in the adjacent text boxes.

You may also use the buttons provided in order to change the appearance of the distribution:

* image:Cumulative_distribution.png[Cumulative distribution.png,width=16,height=16] Toggle between the probability
density function and the cumulative distribution function of the distribution
* image:Interval-left.png[Interval-left.png,width=16,height=16]
image:Interval-between.png[Interval-between.png,width=16,height=16]
image:Interval-right.png[Interval-right.png,width=16,height=16] Modify your graph in order calculate a cumulative
probability (e.g. _P(x ≤ X)_, _P(x ≥ X)_). To calculate a probability select the interval type using the buttons
provided. Then adjust the interval in the adjacent text boxes or drag the corresponding markers along the _x_-axis in
the graph.

== Probability Calculator Style Bar

The _Probability Calculator Stylebar_ provides options to
image:Normal-overlay.png[Normal-overlay.png,width=16,height=16] overlay your distribution with the _Normal Curve_ and to
image:Export16.png[Export16.png,width=16,height=16] export the graph.

[NOTE]
====

You may export your distribution as a picture file (.png), copy it to your computer's clipboard (GeoGebra Desktop) or
copy it to the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View].

====

*Drag and Drop*: In the GeoGebra Desktop Version, you may use _Drag and Drop_ in order to transfer the plot of your
distribution either to the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics
View_ or to another application that will accept images. Just position the mouse at the top of the
image:18px-Menu_view_probability.svg.png[Menu view probability.svg,width=18,height=18] _Probability Calculator_ screen
and the cursor will change to a hand cursor. This new cursor allows you to drag the plot into
image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View 1_ or _2_ to create a
new plot or to drag an image of the plot into another application.

== Statistics

Tab _Statistics_ allows you to conduct a variety of statistical tests. Just select the test you want to work with from
the list available in the drop down menu (e.g. _Z Test of a Mean_) and specify your _Null Hypothesis_, as well as your
_Alternative Hypothesis_. Then, adjust the parameters of your test in the provided text boxes and GeoGebra will
automatically provide the results of your statistical test.
