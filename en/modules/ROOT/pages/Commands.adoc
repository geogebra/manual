Using commands you can produce new and modify existing objects. Please check the list displayed on the right, where
commands have been categorized with respect to their field of application, or check the /Category:Commands.adoc[full
commands list] for further details.

[NOTE]
====

*Notes:*

* Press the [.kcode]#Enter# key after every input to create the corresponding object.
* A command's result may be named by entering a label followed by an equal sign (=). In the example below, the new point
is named S.

[EXAMPLE]
====

To get the intersection point of two lines g and h you can enter `++S = Intersect[g, h]++` (see
xref:/commands/Intersect.adoc[Intersect Command]).

====

* You can also use indices within the names of objects: A~1~ is entered as `++A_1++` while S~AB~ is created using
`++S_{AB}++`. This is part of xref:/LaTeX.adoc[LaTeX syntax].
