= Circle with Center, Radius and Direction Tool

This tool returns a circle in different positions, depending on the object chosen as "direction" (line or plane).

* Selecting a line, a ray or a segment and a point on the circle, then typing the radius value in the related field of
the appearing dialog window, GeoGebra generates a circle whose axis is directed as the object chosen as "direction".
* Selecting a plane (xOy plane or any other previously defined plane) and a point on the circle, then typing the radius
value in the related field of the appearing dialog window, GeoGebra generates a circle in a plane parallel to the one
chosen as "direction", through the given point.

[NOTE]
====

* The order of selection of the first two objects is non influential.
* See also xref:/commands/Circle_Command.adoc[Circle] command.
