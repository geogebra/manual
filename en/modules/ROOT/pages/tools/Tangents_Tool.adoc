= Tangents Tool

Tangents to a conic section can be produced in several ways (see also xref:/commands/Tangent_Command.adoc[Tangent]
command):

* Selecting a point and a conic produces all tangents through the point to the conic.
* Selecting a line and a conic produces all tangents to the conic that are parallel to the selected line.
* Selecting a point and a function produces the tangent line to the function in its point having the same x-coordinate
of the selected point (e.g. if the point is _A_, the tangent is drawn in _x = x(A)_).
* Selecting two circles produces the common tangents to them (up to 4).

[NOTE]

====

*Note:* Type stem:[ y = x^2+2x+1 ] rather than stem:[ f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 ] if you want a *conic* (parabola) rather than
a *function*.

*Note:* _x(A)_ represents the _x_-coordinate of point _A_. If point _A_ lies on the function graph, the tangent runs
through point _A_.
