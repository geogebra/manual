Select a range of cells in the spreadsheet, then click the tool to open the Data Source dialog window. Adjust the data range using the + and - icons at the top left. Specify whether to use the selected data as headers via the image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] icon at the top right.
Then, press the _Analyze_ button to start the data analysis and display relevant data and visualize the data with  stacked boxplots.

[NOTE]
====

In the GeoGebra desktop version, use drag-and-drop to create a dynamic copy of a plot in the Graphics View or transfer a picture of the current plot to other applications that accept images. 
When hovering the mouse near the top of the plot window, the cursor changes to a hand icon. Drag the mouse pointer to image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics
View] 1 or 2 to create a dynamic copy of the current plot. Any change in the analyzed data will be applied to both the original and copied plots. 
If the plot is dragged into an application other than GeoGebra, the exported plot will be static—a snapshot of the GeoGebra plot—and will not be updated when GeoGebra data are updated or modified.
