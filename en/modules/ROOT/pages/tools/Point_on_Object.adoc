= Point on Object Tool
:page-en: tools/Point_on_Object
ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

Activate the tool, then select an object to create a point that will always be inside the xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[object].
The point can be moved within the object using the image:22px-Mode_move.svg.png[Mode
move.svg,width=22,height=22]xref:/tools/Move.adoc[Move Tool].

[NOTE]
====

* A point can be placed inside a closed curve or shape (e.g. circle, ellipse, polygon,...) only if the object's xref:/Object_Properties.adoc[opacity] is non 0. 

* Click on the perimeter of a closed curve or shape (e.g. xref:/Conic_sections.adoc[circle], xref:/Conic_sections.adoc[ellipse], polygon,...), to limit the point's movement along the perimeter of the selected object.

* See also the xref:/commands/PointIn.adoc[PointIn] command.
