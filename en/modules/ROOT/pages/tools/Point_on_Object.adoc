= Point on Object Tool
:page-en: tools/Point_on_Object
ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

To create a point, which is fixed to an xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[object], activate the tool first and then select
the object. This new point can be moved via image:22px-Mode_move.svg.png[Mode
move.svg,width=22,height=22]xref:/tools/Move.adoc[Move Tool], but only within the object.

[NOTE]
====

* To put a point in the interior of a Circle or Ellipse you will need to increase the
xref:/Object_Properties.adoc[Opacity] from 0 first. If you click on the perimeter of an object (e.g.
xref:/Conic_sections.adoc[Circle], xref:/Conic_sections.adoc[Ellipse], Polygon), then the point will be fixed to the
perimeter rather than the interior.

* See also xref:/commands/PointIn.adoc[PointIn] command.
