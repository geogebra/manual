The Pen Tool allows the user to add freehand notes and drawings to the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View]. This makes the Pen Tool particularly useful
when using GeoGebra for presentations or with multimedia interactive whiteboards. To add a freehand note onto a region
of the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_, activate the
tool and draw on your touch screen or with your mouse by holding the left mouse button

GeoGebra stores the notes you traced in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphic View_ as a _PenStroke_ (assigning the name _stroke_ to it). Therefore you can
use several operations on them (e.g. move, rotate, recflect,...).

The default colour of the pen is black, but you can change the pen properties (colour, style, and thickness) using the
xref:/Style_Bar.adoc[Styling Bar].

== Erasing

To erase a portion of your notes created in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_ with the Pen Tool, select the erase tool and move it over the part you want to erase. 
Alternatively, you can press and hold the right mouse button while moving
it over the notes you want to erase. Release the mouse button to finish. To completely delete the _stroke_ you
created, either erase it totally in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16]
_Graphics View_, use the xref:/Context_Menu.adoc[Context Menu] of the object, or delete the corresponding item
in the image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view algebra.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Algebra_View.adoc[Algebra View].
