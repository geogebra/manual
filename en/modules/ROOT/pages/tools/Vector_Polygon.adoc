= Vector Polygon Tool

Successively select at least three free points which will be the vertices of the polygon. Then, select the first point
again in order to close the polygon. The resulting polygon will keep the shape when the first point is dragged, but the
other vertices can be moved freely.

Holding down the [.kcode]#Alt# key when drawing a vector polygon allows to get angles that are a multiple of 15°.
