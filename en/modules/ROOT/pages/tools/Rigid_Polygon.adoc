Successively select at least three free points which will be the vertices of the polygon. Then, click the first point
again in order to close the polygon. The resulting polygon will keep the shape: you can move it and rotate it by moving
two vertices.

Holding down the [.kcode]#Alt# key when drawing a rigid polygon allows to get angles that are a multiple of 15°.
