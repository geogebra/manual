With this tool you can create static and dynamic text or LaTeX formulas in the
image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics
View].

At first, you need to specify the location of the text in one of the following ways:

* Click in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_ to
create a new text at this location.
* Select a point to create a new text that is attached to this point.

[NOTE]
====

You may specify the position of a text as absolute on screen or relative to the coordinate system on tab _Position_ of the
image:18px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=18,height=18] xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties Dialog].

====

Then, a dialog appears where you may enter your text, which can be static, dynamic, or mixed.

The text you type directly in the _Edit_ field is considered as static, i.e. it's not affected by the objects
modifications. If you need to create a dynamic text, which displays the changing values of an object, select the related
object from the _Objects_ drop-down list (GeoGebra Desktop Version) or the tab image:18px-GeoGebra_48.png[GeoGebra
48.png,width=18,height=18] in the _Advanced_ menu (GeoGebra Web and Tablet Apps). The corresponding name is shown,
enclosed in a grey box, in the _Edit_ field. In the GeoGebra Desktop Version, right-clicking on the grey box allows you
to select, if "Definition" or "Value" of the dynamic object is displayed.

It is also possible to perform algebraic operations or apply specific commands to these objects. Just select the grey
box and type in the algebraic operation or GeoGebra xref:/commands/Text_Commands.adoc[text command] desired. The results
of these operations will be dynamically shown in the resulting text, in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu
view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_.

Best visual results are obtained when using LaTex formatting for the formulas. Its use is simple and intuitive: just
check the _LaTeX Formula_ box, and select the desired formula template from the drop-down list. A variety of
mathematical symbols and operators is also available in a drop-down-list (GeoGebra Desktop Version) respectively in a
tab of the _Advanced_ menu (GeoGebra Web and Tablet Apps Version).
