= Perpendicular Line Tool
:page-en: tools/Perpendicular_Line
ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

Activate the tool, then select a line (or a segment) and a point to create the straight line through the point and perpendicular to the selected line (or
segment).

[NOTE]
====

* The line (or segment) must be already existing in the construction. The point can also be created on the fly with a click (or a tap) in the _Graphics View_.
* The created perpendicular line has the same direction as the perpendicular vector to the selected line or segment. (See also the
xref:/commands/PerpendicularVector.adoc[PerpendicularVector] command).
* This tool has also a 3D version: image:24px-Mode_orthogonalthreed.svg.png[Mode
orthogonalthreed.svg,width=24,height=24]  in this case it is necessary to select a line or a plane, then a point.
* See also the xref:/commands/PerpendicularLine.adoc[PerpendicularLine] command.
