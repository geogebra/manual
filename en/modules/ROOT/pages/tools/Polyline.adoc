== Graphics View

Activate the tool, then select consecutively at least three existing points (or click/tap at least three distinct positions in the _Graphics View_) which will be the vertices of the polyline (polygonal chain). End the creation of the polyline by clicking its first vertex again.

Holding down the [.kcode]#Alt# (MacOS : [.kcode]##option##) key when drawing a polyline allows to get angles between segments that are multiple of 15Â°.

[NOTE]

== Spreadsheet View

Select a set of spreadsheet cells that define ordered pairs across rows or columns. Then select the tool to open a dialog for naming, modifying and creating the polyline with vertices at the points with given ordered pairs.
