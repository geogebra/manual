Choose one of the following to create a regular tetrahedron:

* Select two points in the _xOy plane_ to obtain a regular tetrahedron lying on that plane.
* Select two points on the same side of _z=c_ to obtain a regular tetrahedron lying on the plane having _z=c_ as one of
its equations.
* Select two points. If the z-coordinates of the points differ, the regular tetrahedron includes a vertex with the average z-coordinate of the two points.

[NOTE]
====

* The created tetrahedron can be moved and rotated by dragging its three xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[_Free Points_].
* See also xref:/commands/Tetrahedron.adoc[Tetrahedron] command.
