= Locus Tool

Select a point _B_ that depends on another point _A_ and whose locus should be drawn. Then, select point _A_ to create
the locus of point _B_.

[EXAMPLE]

====

* Type `++f(x) = x^2 – 2 x – 1++` into the _Input Bar_ and press the _Enter-key_.
* Place a new point _A_ on the _x_-axis (see image:22px-Mode_point.svg.png[Mode point.svg,width=22,height=22]
xref:/tools/Point_Tool.adoc[Point] tool or xref:/commands/Point_Command.adoc[Point] command).
* Create point `++B = (x(A), f'(x(A)))++` that depends on point _A_.
* Select the tool image:22px-Mode_locus.svg.png[Mode locus.svg,width=22,height=22] _Locus_ and successively select point
_B_ and point _A_.
* Drag point _A_ along the _x_-axis to see point _B_ moving along its locus line.

[NOTE]

====

Point _A_ has to be a point on an object (e.g. line, segment/interval, circle).
