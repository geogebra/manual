= Record to Spreadsheet Tool
:page-en: tools/Record_to_Spreadsheet
ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

[NOTE]
====

In GeoGebra 5.0 this tool was replaced by an option in the
xref:/Context_Menu.adoc[Context Menu] of the image:16px-Menu_view_spreadsheet.svg.png[Menu view
spreadsheet.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Spreadsheet_View.adoc[Spreadsheet View].

====

Select objects and choose
image:16px-Menu-record-to-spreadsheet.svg.png[Menu-record-to-spreadsheet.svg,width=16,height=16] *Record to Spreadsheet*
in the xref:/Context_Menu.adoc[Context Menu], while the image:16px-Menu_view_spreadsheet.svg.png[Menu view
spreadsheet.svg,width=16,height=16] _Spreadsheet View_ is opened.

This works for numbers, points, and vectors.

[NOTE]
====

GeoGebra will use the first two empty columns of the image:16px-Menu_view_spreadsheet.svg.png[Menu view
spreadsheet.svg,width=16,height=16] _Spreadsheet View_ to record the values of the selected objects.
