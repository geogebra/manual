ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

Activate the tool, select a leg point and a vertex, then type the angle size into the input box of the appearing window. 

This means that by selecting the leg point _A_ and the vertex _B_, this tool creates a new point _A’_
and an angle _α_, where _α_ is the angle _ABA’_.
