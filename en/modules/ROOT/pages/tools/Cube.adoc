Select two points to create a cube:

* Select two points in the _xOy plane_ to obtain a cube lying on that plane.
* Select two points on the same side of _z=c_ to obtain a cube lying on the plane having _z=c_ as one of its equations.
* Select two points. If the z-coordinates of the points differ, the cube includes edges parallel to the _xOy plane_.

[NOTE]
====

* The created cube can be moved and rotated by dragging its three xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[_Free Points_].
* See also xref:/commands/Cube.adoc[Cube] command.
