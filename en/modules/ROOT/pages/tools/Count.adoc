This tool is available only in the image:16px-Menu_view_spreadsheet.svg.png[Menu view
spreadsheet.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Spreadsheet_View.adoc[Spreadsheet View]. There are two methods how to use it:

* Select a destination cell, select this tool, then select a cell range. The count of the selected cells will
appear in the destination cell.
* Select a cell range containing more than one cell, then select this tool. If the range has multiple rows,
the count of each column will be inserted below each column. If it has only one row, the count 
will be inserted to the right of the selection. If you hold [.kcode]#Shift# when selecting the icon of
this tool, the count of each row in the selected area is computed.
