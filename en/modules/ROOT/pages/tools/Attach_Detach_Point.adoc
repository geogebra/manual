To *attach a point* to a xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[path] or xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[region] click a
xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[free] point and the path or region. From now on, the point can still be
moved via image:22px-Mode_move.svg.png[Mode move.svg,width=22,height=22]xref:/tools/Move.adoc[Move Tool], but only
within the path or region.

To *detach a point* that is defined as point on path or region simply select the point. The point will become free.

[NOTE]
====

You can also use xref:/commands/Point.adoc[Point Command] and xref:/commands/PointIn.adoc[PointIn Command] for attaching
a point. See also xref:/commands/CopyFreeObject.adoc[CopyFreeObject Command].
