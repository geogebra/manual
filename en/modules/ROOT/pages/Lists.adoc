= Lists
:page-en: Lists
ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

Using curly braces you can create a _list_ of several objects (e.g. points, segments, circles).

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++L = {A, B, C}++` gives you a list consisting of three prior defined points _A_, _B_, and _C_.
* `++L = {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)}++` produces a list that consists of the entered points and also creates these nameless
points.
* The short syntax `++..++` creates a list of successive integers: e.g. `++-5..5++` creates the list _++{-5, -4, -3, -2,
-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}++_.

====

[NOTE]
====

* By default, the elements of this list are not shown in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View].
* Lists can also be used as arguments in list operations (mentioned further in this article) or
xref:/commands/List_Commands.adoc[List Commands].

====

== Accessing Elements of Lists

To access particular elements of a list you can use the xref:/commands/Element.adoc[Element Command] or the simplified
syntax shown in the example below:

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let `++list = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}++`, then:

* `++list(1)++` returns the first element of the list: _1_
* `++list(2)++` returns the second element of the list: _2_
* .../...
* `++list(-1)++` returns the last element of the list: _5_
* `++list(-5)++` returns the first element of the list: _1_
* `++list(0)++` returns _undefined_, as well as `++list(k)++` for k > 5 or k < -5

====

== Comparing Lists of Objects

You can compare two lists of objects by using the following syntaxes and commands:

* `++List1 == List2++`: checks if the two lists are equal as ordered http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple[tuples], and
yields _true_ or _false_.
* `++List1 != List2++`: checks if the two lists are not equal as ordered tuples, and yields _true_ or _false_.
* `++Unique[list1] == Unique[list2]++` or `++list1 \ list2 == {}++` : checks if the two lists are equal as sets (i.e.
all repeated elements are ignored, as well as the elements order) and yields _true_ or _false_.
* `++Sort[list1] == Sort[list2]++`: checks if the two lists are equal as
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset[multisets] (i.e. the elements order is ignored) and yields _true_ or _false_.

See also xref:/commands/Unique.adoc[Unique] and xref:/commands/Sort.adoc[Sort] commands.

== List Operators

`++<Object> ∈ <List>++`: returns _true_ if _Object_ is an element of _List_

`++<List1> ⊆ <List2>++`: returns _true_ if _List1_ is subset of _List2_

`++<List1> ⊂ <List2>++`: returns _true_ if _List1_ is a strict subset of _List2_

`++<List1> \ <List2>++`: creates the set difference of _List1_ and _List2_

== Apply Predefined Operations and Functions to Lists

If you apply xref:/Predefined_Functions_and_Operators.adoc[Predefined Functions and Operators] to lists, you will always
get a new list as a result.

=== Addition and subtraction

* `++List1 + List2++`: adds the corresponding elements of two lists.
+
[NOTE]
====

The two lists need to be of the same length.

====
* `++List + Number++`: adds _Number_ to every element of _List_.
* `++List1 – List2++`: subtracts the elements of _List2_ from corresponding elements of _List1_.
+
[NOTE]
====

The lists need to be of the same length.

====
* `++List – Number++`: subtracts _Number_ from every element of _List_.

=== Multiplication and division

* `++List1 * List2++`: multiplies the corresponding elements of two lists.
+
[NOTE]
====

The lists need to be of the same length. If the two lists are compatible matrices, matrix multiplication is used.

====
* `++List * Number++`: multiplies every _List_ element by the given _Number_.
* `++List1 / List2++`: divides the elements of _List1_ by the corresponding elements of _List2_.
+
[NOTE]
====

The two lists need to be of the same length.

====
* `++List / Number++`: divides every _List_ element by _Number_.
* `++Number / List++`: divides _Number_ by every element of _List_.

[NOTE]
====

See also xref:/Points_and_Vectors.adoc[Vector product].

====

=== Other examples

* `++List ^ 2++`: squares every element of _List_.
* `++2 ^ List++`: creates a list of powers of two, using the _List_ elements as exponents.
* `++List1 ^ List2++`: creates a list containing _a^b_, where _a_ and _b_ are corresponding elements of _List1_ and
_List2_.
* `++sin(List)++`: applies the sine function to every element of _List_.

User defined xref:/Functions.adoc[functions] can be applied the same way as well.
