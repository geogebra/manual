= Lists

Using curly braces you can create a _list_ of several objects (e.g. points, segments, circles).

[EXAMPLE]

====

* `L = {A, B, C}` gives you a list consisting of three prior defined points _A_, _B_, and _C_.
* `L = {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)}` produces a list that consists of the entered points and also creates these nameless
points.
* The short syntax `..` creates a list of successive integers: e.g. `-5..5` creates the list \{_-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5_}.

*Notes:*

* By default, the elements of this list are not shown in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View].
* Lists can also be used as arguments in list operations (mentioned further in this article) or
xref:/commands/List_Commands.adoc[List Commands].

== [#Accessing_Elements_of_Lists]#Accessing Elements of Lists#

To access particular elements of a list you can use the xref:/commands/Element_Command.adoc[Element Command] or the
simplified syntax shown in the example below:

[EXAMPLE]

====

Let `list = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, then:

* `list(1)` returns the first element of the list: _1_
* `list(2)` returns the second element of the list: _2_
* .../...
* `list(-1)` returns the last element of the list: _5_
* `list(-5)` returns the first element of the list: _1_
* `list(0)` returns _undefined_, as well as `list(k)` for k > 5 or k < -5

====

== [#Comparing_Lists_of_Objects]#Comparing Lists of Objects#

You can compare two lists of objects by using the following syntaxes and commands:

* `List1 == List2`: checks if the two lists are equal as ordered http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple[tuples], and yields
_true_ or _false_.
* `List1 != List2`: checks if the two lists are not equal as ordered tuples, and yields _true_ or _false_.
* `Unique[list1] == Unique[list2]` or `list1 \ list2 == {}` : checks if the two lists are equal as sets (i.e. all
repeated elements are ignored, as well as the elements order) and yields _true_ or _false_.
* `Sort[list1] == Sort[list2]`: checks if the two lists are equal as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset[multisets]
(i.e. the elements order is ignored) and yields _true_ or _false_.

See also xref:/commands/Unique_Command.adoc[Unique] and xref:/commands/Sort_Command.adoc[Sort] commands.

== [#List_Operators]#List Operators#

`<Object> ∈ <List>`: returns _true_ if _Object_ is an element of _List_

`<List1> ⊆ <List2>`: returns _true_ if _List1_ is subset of _List2_

`<List1> ⊂ <List2>`: returns _true_ if _List1_ is a strict subset of _List2_

`<List1> \ <List2>`: creates the set difference of _List1_ and _List2_

== [#Apply_Predefined_Operations_and_Functions_to_Lists]#Apply Predefined Operations and Functions to Lists#

If you apply xref:/Predefined_Functions_and_Operators.adoc[Predefined Functions and Operators] to lists, you will always
get a new list as a result.

=== [#Addition_and_subtraction]#Addition and subtraction#

* `List1 + List2`: adds the corresponding elements of two lists.
+
[NOTE]

====

The two lists need to be of the same length.

====
* `List + Number`: adds _Number_ to every element of _List_.
* `List1 – List2`: subtracts the elements of _List2_ from corresponding elements of _List1_.
+
[NOTE]

====

The lists need to be of the same length.

====
* `List – Number`: subtracts _Number_ from every element of _List_.

=== [#Multiplication_and_division]#Multiplication and division#

* `List1 * List2`: multiplies the corresponding elements of two lists.
+
[NOTE]

====

The lists need to be of the same length. If the two lists are compatible matrices, matrix multiplication is used.

====
* `List * Number`: multiplies every _List_ element by the given _Number_.
* `List1 / List2`: divides the elements of _List1_ by the corresponding elements of _List2_.
+
[NOTE]

====

The two lists need to be of the same length.

====
* `List / Number`: divides every _List_ element by _Number_.
* `Number / List`: divides _Number_ by every element of _List_.

[NOTE]

====

See also xref:/Points_and_Vectors.adoc[Vector product].

====

=== [#Other_examples]#Other examples#

* `List ^ 2`: squares every element of _List_.
* `2 ^ List`: creates a list of powers of two, using the _List_ elements as exponents.
* `List1 ^ List2`: creates a list containing _a^b_, where _a_ and _b_ are corresponding elements of _List1_ and _List2_.
* `sin(List)`: applies the sine function to every element of _List_.

User defined xref:/Functions.adoc[functions] can be applied the same way as well.
