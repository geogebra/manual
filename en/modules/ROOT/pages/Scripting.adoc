Script is a sequence of commands, that are executed one after each other.

GeoGebra supports two scripting languages - GGBScript and Javascript. You can enter scripts in the _Scripting_ tab of
the image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties Dialog]
of the object you want to assign a script to.

[NOTE]
====

The _Properties_ panel needs to be closed for scripts to work.

====

Different objects support different types of scripting; the execution of scripts can be triggered by :

* clicking a particular object (_OnClick_ tab)
* updating a particular object (when value or properties of the object are changed) (_OnUpdate_ tab)
* changing the content of an input box (_OnChange_ tab)
* when the mouse button is released (or finger is removed from the screen for touch devices) after dragging an object
(_On Drag-end_ tab)
* loading the file (for JavaScript - _Global Javascript_ tab)
* Javascript listeners (see /Reference:JavaScript.adoc[Reference:JavaScript])

The difference between _OnUpdate_ and _OnChange_ scripting for an input box is that in case the script is entered in the
_OnUpdate_ tab, it is executed only when the focus is removed from the input box (by e.g. clicking on a button, clicking
in the _Graphics View_, etc...), whereas scripting entered in the _OnChange tab_ will be executed as soon as the content
of the input box changes, and the focus is still on the input box itself.

[NOTE]
====

* Check this https://www.geogebra.org/m/bek5uqah demo of _OnChange_ and _OnUpdate_ scripts for an input box.
* Check this https://www.geogebra.org/m/kxgvyqvj demo of _OnDrag-end_ scripting for a draggable point.

== GGBScript

You can create scripts consisting of GeoGebra commands, as you would use them in the xref:/Input_Bar.adoc[Input Bar].
After triggering the script, every command is executed, in the same order they are written, sequentially.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* _a_ is an integer-valued xref:/tools/Slider.adoc[slider] ranging from 1 to 3 (therefore Increment equals 1)
* type in: `++list1 = {"red", "green", "blue"}++`
* in properties of _a_, set "On Update" script to `++SetColor(a, Element(list1, a))++`
* by moving the slider you change its color

====

*Explanation:* Every time the slider is moved, there an update occurs. So, for every move the script is called and the
value of _a_ is used to get one color from the list and change the color of the slider _a_.

[NOTE]
====

You can use `++#++` to start a comment

[NOTE]

*image:18px-Bulbgraph.png[Note,title="Note",width=18,height=22] Hint:* Some commands can only be used for scripting. The
list of these command is available in the xref:/commands/Scripting_Commands.adoc[Scripting_Commands] page.

====

== JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language used by many Internet technologies. Unlike GeoGebra Script, in Javascript commands
don't have to be executed as a simple sequence, but a control flow (`++if++`, `++while++`, `++for++`) can be used. For
generic JavaScript you can find a nice tutorial on
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide[developer.mozilla.org]. In GeoGebra, you can use special JavaScript
methods which allow you to change the construction. These methods belong to ggbApplet object, which means that you call
them as `++ggbApplet.method_name(parameter,..,parameter)++`. For complete list of these methods see
/Reference:JavaScript.adoc[Reference:JavaScript].

[EXAMPLE]
====

....
for(var i =0;i<10;i++) 
   ggbApplet.evalCommand("A_"+i+"=(random()*10,random()*10)");
....

This script creates 10 points _A~0~_ to _A~9~_ at random coordinates.

====

[NOTE]
====

Scripting with JavaScript is very versatile, but many tasks can also be achieved using the simpler GeoGebraScript.

====

=== Global JavaScript

In the _Global JavaScript_ part of the _Scripting_ tab in the
image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] _Properties Dialog_ you may define *functions* (not
variables) which will be available from the other scripts. You can also define function _ggbOnInit(name, api)_, which is
called automatically once the construction is loaded. The _ggbOnInit_ function can be used for registering some
_listeners_, as shown below.

[EXAMPLE]
====

....
function onAdd(name){
    alert("Object "+name+" was added.");
}

function ggbOnInit(name, api){
    api.registerAddListener("onAdd");
}
....

First we defined function _onAdd_ that given a string shows a message depending on that string. After that, using the
_ggbOnInit_ function, we told GeoGebra to call this function whenever a new object is added. Once we reload our
construction, function _ggbOnInit_ will be called and since then, when user adds a point named e.g. _A_, message "Object
A was added" will appear.

====

You can also use _listeners_ for actions like rename, delete and clear construction. A complete list is available in
/Reference:JavaScript.adoc[Reference:JavaScript].

[NOTE]
====

Using any ggbApplet methods in _Global JavaScript_ outside of ggbOnInit will not work as intended since they will be
called before the construction is loaded.
