RandomBinomial( <Number of Trials>, <Probability> )::
  Generates a random number from a binomial distribution with _n_ trials and probability _p_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++RandomBinomial(3, 0.1)++` gives _j ∈ \{0, 1, 2, 3}_, where the probability of getting _j_ is the probability of an
event with probability _0.1_ occuring _j_ times in three tries.
