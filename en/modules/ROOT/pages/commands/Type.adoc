Type( <Object> )::

For conics and quadrics this command returns a number representing the conic/quadric type according to the table below.
In this context, an _empty conic_ (or quadric) is one whose coefficients are defined, but that does not contain any real
point, e.g. _x_^2^ + _y_^2^ = -1. For conics, GeoGebra distinguishes double line (special case of parallel lines with distance
0) and single line (special case of circle with infinite diameter, may result from circle inversion). For quadrics there
is no such distinction.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Type(x²+y²=1)++` yields 4 which stands for circle.
