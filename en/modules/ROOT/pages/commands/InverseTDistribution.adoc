InverseTDistribution( <Degrees of Freedom>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distribution[t-distribution] at _p_, where the t-distribution has _d_ degrees of
  freedom. In other words, finds _r_ such that _P(X≤r)=p_, where X is random variable with t-distribution. Probability
  _p_ must be from [0,1].
