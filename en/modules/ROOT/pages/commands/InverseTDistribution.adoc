InverseTDistribution( <Degrees of Freedom>, <Probability> )::
  Evaluates at _p_ the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of a 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distribution[t-distribution] with the given number of _degrees of freedom_. In other words, it finds _r_ such that _P(Xâ‰¤r)=p_, where X is a random variable with a t-distribution. Probability
  _p_ must be a value in the closed interval [0,1].
