  _w_ and _h_ are width and height of the Graphics View in pixels. Always uses

View in pixels; for _n = 10_ returns point _(w, h, 0)_, where _w_ and _h_ are width and height of the main window in
pixels; for _n = 11_ returns view direction (for parallel projections) or eye position (for e.g. perspective
projection); for _n = 12_ returns screen left-to-right direction; for _n = 13_ returns scales for x, y, z axes.
