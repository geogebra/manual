Corner( <Number of Corner> )::
  For number _n = 1, 2, 3, 4_ creates a point at the corner of the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
  graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View], for _n = 5_ returns point _(w, h)_, where
  _w_ and _h_ are width and height of the Graphics View in pixels. Always uses
  image:16px-Menu_view_graphics1.svg.png[Menu view graphics1.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[first
  Graphics View], even if second is active.

[NOTE]
====

Corner( <Number of Corner> ) won't work inside other commands. Instead create eg `++C_1 = Corner(1)++` and use that.

Corner( <Graphics View>, <Number of Corner> )::
  Creates a point at the corner of image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16]
  Graphics View (1, 2) which is never visible in that view. Supported values of number _n_ are _1, 2, 3, 4_ and _5_ as
  above.

[NOTE]
====

Corner( <Graphics View>, <Number of Corner> ) won't work inside other commands. Instead create eg
`++C_1 = Corner(1, 1)++` and use that.

Use `++-1++` for the image:16px-Perspectives_algebra_3Dgraphics.svg.png[Perspectives algebra
3Dgraphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/3D_Graphics_View.adoc[3D Graphics View]'s corners (available values for
_Number_: from 1 to 8).  Moreover:

* `++Corner(-1,9)++` returns point (_w_, _h_, 0), where _w_ and _h_ are width and height of the 3D Graphics
View in pixels

* `++Corner(-1,10)++` returns point (_w_, _h_, 0), where _w_ and _h_ are width and height of the main window in
pixels

* `++Corner(-1,11)++` returns view direction (for parallel projections) or eye position (for e.g. perspective
projection)

* `++Corner(-1,12)++` returns screen left-to-right direction

* `++Corner(-1,13)++` returns scales for _x_, _y_ and _z_ axes.

====


Corner( <Image>, <Number of Corner> )::
  Creates a point at the corner of the image (number _n_ = 1, 2, 3, 4).

Corner( <Text>, <Number of Corner> )::
  Creates a point at the corner of the text (number _n_ = 1, 2, 3, 4).

[NOTE]
====

* `++Corner( <Text>, <Number of Corner> )++` won't work inside the xref:/commands/Sequence.adoc[Sequence] or
xref:/commands/Zip.adoc[Zip] commands. Also the _Absolute Position on Screen_ property must be unchecked

* The numbering of the corners is counter‚Äêclockwise and starts at the lower left corner.
