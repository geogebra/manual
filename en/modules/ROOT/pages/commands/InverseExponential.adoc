InverseExponential( <Lambda>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of an
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution[Exponential distribution] at probability _p_, where the
  Exponential distribution is defined by the given parameter _lambda_.
  In other words, finds _t_ such that _P(X â‰¤ t) = p_, where _X_ is an Exponential random variable.
  Probability _p_ must be a value in the closed interval [0,1].
