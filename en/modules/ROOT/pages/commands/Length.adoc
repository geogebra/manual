Length( <Object> )::
  Yields the length of the object.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Length( <Vector> )++` yields the length of the vector.
* `++Length( <Point> )++` yields the length of the position vector of the given point.
* `++Length( <List> )++` yields the length of the list, which is the number of elements in the list.
* `++Length( <Text> )++` yields the number of characters in the text.
* `++Length( <Locus> )++` returns the number of points that the given locus is made up of. Use
xref:/commands/Perimeter.adoc[Perimeter](Locus) to get the length of the locus itself. For details see the article about
xref:/commands/First.adoc[First Command].
* `++Length( <Arc> )++` returns the _arc length_ (i.e. just the length of the curved section) of an arc or sector.

====

Length( <Function>, <Start x-Value>, <End x-Value> )::
  Yields the length of the function graph in the given interval.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Length(2x, 0, 1)++` returns _2.236067977_, about stem:[\sqrt{5}].

====

Length( <Function>, <Start Point>, <End Point> )::
  Yields the length of the function graph between the two points.

[NOTE]
====

If the given points do not lie on the function graph, their x‚Äêcoordinates are used to determine the interval.

====

Length( <Curve>, <Start t-Value>, <End t-Value> )::
  Yields the length of the curve between the two values *of the parameter*.
Length( <Curve>, <Start Point>, <End Point> )::
  Yields the length of the curve between the two points that lie on the curve.



== CAS Syntax

Length( <Function>, <Start x-Value>, <End x-Value> )::
  Calculates the length of a function graph between the two points.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Length(2 x, 0, 1)++` yields stem:[\sqrt{5}].

====

Length( <Function>, <Variable>, <Start x-Value>, <End x-Value> )::
  Calculates the length of a function graph from _Start x-value_ to _End x-value_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Length(2 a, a,  0, 1)++` yields stem:[\sqrt{5}].
