====

Normalize( <List of Numbers> )::
  Returns a list containing the _normalized_ form of the given numbers.

====

Normalize( <List of Points> )::
  Returns a list containing the _normalized_ form of the given points.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Normalize({(1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1)})++` returns _{(0,1), (0.25,0.75), (0.5,0.5), (0.75,0.25), (1,0)}_.

[NOTE]
====

* If you are doing calculations using big or small numbers (eg using xref:/commands/FitGrowth.adoc[FitGrowth]) then
normalizing them might avoid rounding/overflow errors
* This command is not applicable to 3D points.
* The operation of _normalization_ maps a value _x_ to the interval [0, 1] using the linear function stem:[x \rightarrow \frac{x-Min(list)}{Max(list)-Min(list)}].
