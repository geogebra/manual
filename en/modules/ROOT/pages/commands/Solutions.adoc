[NOTE]
====

Starting from version 823 this command behaves as xref:/commands/Solve.adoc[Solve] command, except for the format of the
result: command _Solutions_ returns a list of values, while command _Solve_ returns a list of equations in the form
_variable name = value_.

====

Solutions( <Equation> )::
  Solves a given equation for the main variable and returns a list of all solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Solutions(x^2 = 4x)++` yields _{0, 4}_.

== CAS Syntax


Solutions( <Equation>, <Variable> )::
  Solves an equation for a given unknown variable and returns a list of all solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Solutions(x * a^2 = 4a, a)++` yields {stem:[\frac{4}{x},0]}.

====

Solutions( <List of Equations>, <List of Variables> )::
  Solves a set of equations for a given set of unknown variables and returns a list of all solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Solutions({x = 4 x + y , y + x = 2}, {x, y})++` yields _{{-1, 3}}_, the sole solution of _x = 4x + y_ and _y + x
= 2_, displayed as stem:[\begin{pmatrix}-1&3\end{pmatrix}].
* `++Solutions({2a^2 + 5a + 3 = b, a + b = 3}, {a, b})++` yields _{{-3, 6}, {0, 3}}_, displayed as
stem:[\begin{pmatrix}-3&6\\0&3\end{pmatrix}].

====

[NOTE]
====

* Sometimes you need to do some manipulation to allow the automatic solver to work, for example
`++ Solutions(TrigExpand(sin(5/4 π + x) - cos(x - 3/4 π) = sqrt(6) * cos(x) - sqrt(2))) ++`
* See also xref:/commands/Solve.adoc[Solve Command].
