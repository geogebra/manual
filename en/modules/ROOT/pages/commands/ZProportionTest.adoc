ZProportionTest( <Sample Proportion>, <Sample Size>, <Hypothesized Proportion>, <Tail> )::
  Performs a one sample _Z_ test of a proportion using the given sample statistics. _Hypothesized Proportion_ is the
  population proportion assumed in the null hypothesis. _Tail_ has possible values "<", ">" , "≠". These specify the
  alternative hypothesis as follows:

  "<" = population proportion < _Hypothesized Proportion_
  ">" = population proportion > _Hypothesized Proportion_
  "≠" = population proportion ≠ _Hypothesized Proportion_

Results are returned in list form as {Probability value, Z test statistic}.
