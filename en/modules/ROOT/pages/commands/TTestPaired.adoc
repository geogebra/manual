TTestPaired( <List of Sample Data 1>, <List of Sample Data 2>, <Tail> )::
  Performs a paired t-test using the given lists of paired sample data. _Tail_ has possible values "<", ">" , "≠" that
  determine the following alternative hypotheses: +
  "<" = μ < 0 +
  ">" = μ > 0 +
  "≠" = μ ≠ 0 +
  ( μ is the mean paired difference of the population)

Results are returned in list form as _{Probabilty value, t-test statistic}_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++TTestPaired({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {1, 1, 3, 5, 5}, "<")++` yields _{0.5, 0}_.
