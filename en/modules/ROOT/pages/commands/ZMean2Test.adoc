ZMean2Test( <List of Sample Data 1>, <σ1>, <List of Sample Data 2>, <σ2>, <Tail> )::
  Performs a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test[Z test] of the difference between two population means using the given
  lists of sample data and the population standard deviations. Tail has possible values "<", ">" , "≠" that determine
  the following alternative hypotheses: +
  "<" = difference in population means < 0 +
  ">" = difference in population means > 0 +
  "≠" = difference in population means ≠ 0

Results are returned in list form as {Probability value, Z test statistic}.

ZMean2Test( <Sample Mean 1 >, <σ1>, <Sample Size 1>, <Sample Mean 2 >, <σ2>, <Sample Size 2>, <Tail> )::
  Performs a Z test of the difference between two population means using the given sample statistics and population
  standard deviations. _Tail_ is defined as above.
