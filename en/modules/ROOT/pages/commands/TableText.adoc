TableText( <List>, <List>, ... )::
  Creates a text that contains a table of the list objects.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++TableText({x^2, 4}, {x^3, 8}, {x^4, 16})++` creates a table as a text object with three rows and two columns. All
items of the table are left aligned.
* `++TableText(Sequence(i^2, i, 1, 10))++` creates a table as a text object with one row. All items of the table are
left aligned.

====

[NOTE]
====

By default, each list is displayed in its own row of the table.

====

TableText( <List>, <List>, ..., <Alignment of Text> )::
  Creates a text that contains a table of the list objects. The optional text “Alignment of text” controls the
  orientation and alignment of the table text, as well as the alignment of the separator in decimal values.

[NOTE]
====

Possible values are "vl", "vc", "vr", "v", "h", "hl", "hc", "hr" and "." or "%" - the default value is "hl".

* "v" = vertical, i. e. lists are columns
* "h" = horizontal, i. e. lists are rows
* "l" = left aligned
* "r" = right aligned
* "c" = centered
* "." = aligned on decimal points
* "a" = like "." but also displays the padding zeros
* "%" = converted to a percentage, and aligned on decimal points
* "p" = like "%" but also displays the padding zeros

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++TableText({1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 4, 9, 16}, "v")++` creates a text with two columns and four rows whose elements are
left aligned.
* `++TableText({1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 4, 9, 16}, "h")++` creates a text with two rows and four columns whose elements are
left aligned.
* `++TableText({11.2, 123.1, 32423.9, "234.0"}, "vr")++` creates a text with one column whose elements are right
aligned.
* `++TableText({A1:A10, B1:B10, C1:C10}, "vl")++` creates a text with three columns whose elements (left aligned) are
the objects in the given _Spreadsheet_ cells.
* `++TableText({{2011.56, 2, 3.7, 4}, {1, 4.2, 9, 16.365}}, "v.")++` creates a text whose elements are aligned on
decimal points image:TabPtDec.png[TabPtDec.png,width=152,height=111]
* `++TableText({{2011.56, 2, 3.7, 4}, {1, 4.2, 9, 16.365}}, "v%")++` creates a text whose elements are converted to a
percentage, and aligned on decimal points image:200px-TableuPourCent.png[TableuPourCent.png,width=200,height=89]

====

TableText( <List>, <List>, ..., <Alignment of Text>, <Minimum Cell Width>)::
  Creates a text that contains a table of the list objects, with given alignment and cell width (in pixels).

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++TableText({x², 4}, {x³, 8}, {x⁴, 16}, "c", 50)++` creates a table with three rows and two columns. All items in the
table are centered and the cell width is 50 px.

====

TableText( <List>, <List>, ..., <Alignment of Text>, <Minimum Cell Width>, <Minimum Cell Height>)::
  Creates a text that contains a table of the list objects, with given alignment, cell width and height (in pixels).

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++TableText({{"left", "center", "right"}, {"l", "c", "r"}}, "|_lcr", 45, 80)++` creates a table with two rows and
three columns. All items in the table have a different alignment. Each cell of the table is 45 px wide and 80 px high.

====

[NOTE]
====

The _width_ and the _height_ of a _TableText_ depend on the font size setting.

====

It's also possible to insert:

* different types of brackets, using the following symbols ||||, ||, {}, [] or ()
* line separators, using the symbol _
* column separators, using the symbol |
* different colourings

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++TableText({1, 2}, {3, 4}, "c()")++` creates the text stem:[\begin{pmatrix}{} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \\ \end{pmatrix} ]
* `++TableText({1, 2}, {3, 4}, "c|_")++` creates the text
image:50px-TabellaTesto.png[TabellaTesto.png,width=50,height=56]
* `++TableText({1, 2}, {3, 4}, "||")++` creates the text stem:[ \begin{vmatrix}{} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \\ \end{vmatrix} ]
* `++TableText({1, 2}, {3, 4}, "||||")++` creates the text stem:[\begin{Vmatrix}{} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \\ \end{Vmatrix} ]
* `++TableText({{"2x+3y=5","5x+8y=12"}},"{v")++` creates the text stem:[ \left\{\begin{matrix} 2x+3y=5\\ 5x+8y=12
\end{matrix}\right.]
* `++TableText({{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}}, "-/|_v")++` creates a table with
border and no separation lines.
* `++TableText({{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}}, "|11001 _110001 h")++` creates a
table with border and one separation line to the right of the first column and under the first row of contents. The
value 1 in the syntax means that there is a separation line between the numbers and the value 0 means that there is no
separation line or border.
* `++TableText({{"\blue{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}", "\red{4, 3, 2, 1, 0}"}}, "v")++` creates a table having the objects in the
first row coloured in blue, the ones in the second row coloured in red.

[NOTE]
====

The xref:/Style_Bar.adoc[Style Bar] of a _TableText_ object allows the user to customize the object's appearance,
background and text colour and text style.
