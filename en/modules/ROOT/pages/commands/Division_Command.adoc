= Division Command

Division( <Dividend Number>, <Divisor Number> )::
  Gives the quotient (integer part of the result) and the remainder of the division of the two numbers.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`Division(16, 3)` yields _\{5, 1}_.

====

Division( <Dividend Polynomial>, <Divisor Polynomial> )::
  Gives the quotient and the remainder of the division of the two polynomials.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`Division(x^2 + 3 x + 1, x - 1)` yields _\{x + 4, 5}_.

====

[NOTE]
====

In the _Algebra View_ only one variable can be used and it will always be renamed to _x_. In the _CAS View_
multivariable division is also supported.

[EXAMPLE]
====

*Examples:*

* `Division(x^2+y^2, x+y)` yields _\{x - y, 2y^2}_.
* `Division(x^2+y^2, y+x)` yields _\{y - x, 2x^2}_.
