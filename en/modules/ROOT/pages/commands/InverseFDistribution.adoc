InverseFDistribution( <Numerator Degrees of Freedom>, <Denominator Degrees of Freedom>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of an
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution[F-distribution] at probability _p_, where the F-distribution is defined by
  the given _degrees of freedom_.
  In other words, it finds _t_ such that _P(X â‰¤ t) = p_, where _X_ is a random variable with an F-distribution.
  Probability _p_ must be a value in the closed interval [0,1].
