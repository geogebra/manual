ZProportion2Test( <Sample Proportion 1>, <Sample Size 1>, <Sample Proportion 2>, <Sample Size 2>, <Tail> )::
  Performs a test of the difference between two population proportions using the given sample statistics. _Tail_ has
  possible values "<", ">" , "≠". These specify the alternative hypothesis as follows:

  "<" = difference in population proportions < 0
  ">" = difference in population proportions > 0
  "≠" = difference in population proportions ≠ 0

Results are returned in list form as {Probability value, Z test statistic}.
