FitLogistic( <List of Points> )::
  Calculates the regression curve in the form a/(1 + b e^(-kx)).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++FitLogistic({(-6, 2), (0, 2), (3, 4), (3.4, 8)})++` yields stem:[ \frac{1.98}{1 - 0.03 e^{1x}}].

====

[NOTE]
====

* The first and last data points should be fairly close to the curve. The list should have at least 3 points, preferably
more.

* If you work with big/small numbers, you should consider normalizing them for a more accurate result, see
