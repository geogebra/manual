UpdateConstruction( )::
  Recomputes all objects (random numbers are regenerated). Same as [.kcode]#F9# or [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#R#.

[NOTE]
====

If you want to refresh the view (e.g. to remove xref:/Tracing.adoc[traces] from
image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics
View]) you can use `++ZoomIn(1)++` instead, which is the same as [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#F#. You may also need
xref:/commands/SetActiveView.adoc[SetActiveView(1)] or xref:/commands/SetActiveView.adoc[SetActiveView(2)] first if you
are using two Graphics Views.

====

UpdateConstruction( <Number of times> )::
  Performs the command `++UpdateConstruction()++` several times.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++UpdateConstruction(2)++` updates the construction twice (e.g. to record several dice throws to the spreadsheet).
