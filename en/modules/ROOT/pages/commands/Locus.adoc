Locus( <Point Creating Locus Line Q>, <Point P>)::
  Returns the locus curve of the point _Q_, which depends on the point _P_.
Locus( <Point Creating Locus Line Q>, <Slider t>)::
  Returns the locus curve of the point _Q_, which depends on the values assumed by the slider _t_.
Locus( <Slopefield>, <Point> )::
  Returns the locus curve which equates to the slopefield at the given point.
Locus( <f(x, y)>, <Point> )::
  Returns the locus curve which equates to the solution of the differential equation stem:[\frac\{dy}\{dx}=f(x,y)] in
  the given point. The solution is calculated numerically.

[NOTE]
====

Point _P_ needs to be a point on an object (e. g. line, segment, circle).

Loci are specific object types, and appear as xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[auxiliary objects].
Besides Locus command, they are the result of some xref:/commands/Discrete_Math_Commands.adoc[Discrete Math Commands]
and xref:/commands/SolveODE.adoc[SolveODE Command]. Loci are xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[paths] and can be used within
path-related commands such as xref:/commands/Point.adoc[Point]. Their properties depend on how they were obtained, see
e.g. xref:/commands/Perimeter.adoc[Perimeter Command] and xref:/commands/First.adoc[First Command].

dependent point is the result of a xref:/commands/Point.adoc[Point Command] with two parameters, or a
