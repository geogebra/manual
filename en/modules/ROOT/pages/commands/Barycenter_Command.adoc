= Barycenter Command

Barycenter( <List of Points>, <List of Weights> )::
  Set the center of a system of points in the list, defined as the average of their positions, weighted by their value,
  using the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass[proper formula].

[EXAMPLE]
====

*Examples:*

* `++Barycenter({(2, 0), (0, 2), (-2, 0), (0, -2)}, {1, 1, 1, 1})++` yields point _A(0, 0)_
* `++Barycenter({(2, 0), (0, 2), (-2, 0), (0, -2)}, {2, 1, 1, 1})++` yields point _B(0.4, 0)_. The _x_-coordinate of
this point was determined by _stem:[ \frac\{1}\{ 2+1+1+1 }*(2*2+1*0+1*(-2)+1*0)] = stem:[\frac\{1}\{ 5 }*2] = 0.4_
