HyperGeometric( <Population Size>, <Number of Successes>, <Sample Size>)::
  Returns a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution[Hypergeometric distribution] bar graph.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Parameters:

* _Population size_: number of balls in an urn
* _Number of Successes_: number of white balls in the urn
* _Sample Size_: number of balls drawn from the urn

A random sample is repeatedly extracted from an urn, without replacement. `++HyperGeometric(100, 50, 5)++` generates a bar graph showing the probability distribution of the number of white balls in the sample.

====

HyperGeometric( <Population Size>, <Number of Successes>, <Sample Size>, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
  When _Cumulative = false_ returns a bar graph of a Hypergeometric distribution, otherwise it returns the graph of a cumulative Hypergeometric distribution function.
  First three parameters are same as above.

HyperGeometric( <Population Size>, <Number of Successes>, <Sample Size>, <Variable Value>, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
  Let X be a Hypergeometric random variable and v the variable value. The first three parameters are same as above.
  * When _Cumulative = false_ it returns P( X = _v_) 
  * When _Cumulative = true_ it returns P( X ≤ _v_)

 
[EXAMPLE]
====

Assume you select two balls out of ten balls, two of which are white, without putting any back.

* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 0, false)++` yields stem:[\frac{28}{45}], the probability of selecting zero white balls,
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 1, false)++` yields stem:[\frac{16}{45}], the probability of selecting one white ball,
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 2, false)++` yields stem:[\frac{1}{45}], the probability of selecting both white balls,
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 3, false)++` yields _0_, the probability of selecting three white balls.
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 0, true)++` yields stem:[\frac{28}{45}], the probability of selecting zero (or less)
white balls,
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 1, true)++` yields stem:[\frac{44}{45}], the probability of selecting one or less white
balls,
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 2, true)++` yields _1_, the probability of selecting two or less white balls and
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 3, true)++` yields _1_, the probability of selecting three or less white balls.

== CAS Syntax

In the image:16px-Menu_view_cas.svg.png[Menu view cas.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/CAS_View.adoc[CAS View] you can use
only the following syntax:

HyperGeometric( <Population Size>, <Number of Successes>, <Sample Size>, <Variable Value>, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
  Let X be a Hypergeometric random variable and v the variable value.  The first three parameters are the same as above.
 * When _Cumulative = false_ it returns P( X = _v_) 
  * When _Cumulative = true_ it returns P( X ≤ _v_)
