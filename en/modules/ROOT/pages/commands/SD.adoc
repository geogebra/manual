SD( <List of Raw Data> )::
  Calculates the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation[standard deviation] of the numbers in the list.

[NOTE]
====

This command has also the equivalent syntax `stdevp( <List of Raw Data> )`.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++SD({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})++` yields _1.41_

* `++stdevp({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})++` yields _1.41_

====

SD( <List of Numbers>, <List of Frequencies> )::
  Calculates the weighted _standard deviation_ of the given numbers.

[NOTE]
====

This command has also the equivalent syntax `stdevp( <List of Numbers>, <List of Frequencies> )`.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++SD({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {5, 4, 3, 2, 1})++` yields _1.25_
* `++stdevp({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {5, 4, 3, 2, 1})++` yields _1.25_

SD( <List of Raw Data> )::
  Calculates the _standard deviation_ of the numbers in the list.

[NOTE]
====

This command has also the equivalent syntax `stdevp( <List of Raw Data> )`.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++SD({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})++` yields stem:[\sqrt{2}].
* `++stdevp({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})++` yields stem:[\sqrt{2}].
* `++SD({-3 + 2 x, -1- 4 x, -2 + 5 x^2})++` is xref:/tools/Evaluate.adoc[evaluated] as stem:[ \sqrt{2}
\frac{\sqrt{25x⁴ + 10x³ + 28x² - 18x + 3} } { 3 } ].

====

SD( <List of Numbers>, <List of Frequencies> )::
  Calculates the weighted _standard deviation_ of the given numbers.

[NOTE]
====

This command has also the equivalent syntax `stdevp( <List of Numbers>, <List of Frequencies> )`.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++SD({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {5, 4, 3, 2, 1})++` yields stem:[\frac{\sqrt{14}}{3}]
* `++stdevp({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {5, 4, 3, 2, 1})++` yields stem:[\frac{\sqrt{14}}{3}]
