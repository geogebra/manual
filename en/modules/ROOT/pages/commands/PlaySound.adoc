PlaySound( <URL> )::
  Plays an MP3 (.mp3) file

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++PlaySound("https://github.com/murkle/utils/raw/refs/heads/master/welcome-to-geogebra-markus.mp3")++`
* `++PlaySound("#J2sQQfwQ")++` plays an http://www.geogebra.org/m/J2sQQfwQ[.mp3 that has been uploaded to GeoGebra]
* `++PlaySound("https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B7xCmZaU3oU2eXFNUzd6ZlZJS0U&authuser=0&export=download")++` plays an
.mp3 from Google Drive
* `++PlaySound("https://www.dropbox.com/s/27skpv82odjp7ej/material-1264825.mp3?dl=1")++` plays an .mp3 from DropBox

====

[NOTE]
====

To work on iOS (and also if you want immediate playback) then you can encode the .mp3 as an inline base64-encoded data:
URL, see https://www.geogebra.org/m/wztkqxuv for an example. It must start with the _exact_ string
`++data:audio/mp3;base64,++` to work in GeoGebra Classic 5. You can use this utility to convert .MP3s into the syntax
needed in GeoGebra https://test.geogebra.org/~mike/utils/base64Encode.html

====

PlaySound( <Boolean Play> )::
  Pause or resume play (not MP3 files)
  `++PlaySound(true)++` = play, `++PlaySound(false)++` = pause.

PlaySound( <Function>, <Min Value>, <Max Value> )::
  Plays a sound generated by Function, a time-valued function with range [-1,1]. The time units are seconds and the
  sound is played from time Min Value to Max Value. Sound is generated by 8-bit samples taken at a rate of 8000 samples
  per second.

This plays a pure sine wave tone at 440 Hz (musical note A) for one second.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++PlaySound(sin(440 2Pi x), 0, 1)++`

====

PlaySound( <Function>, <Min Value>, <Max Value>, <Sample Rate>, <Sample Depth> )::
  Plays a sound generated by Function, a time-valued function with range [-1,1]. The time units are seconds and the
  sound is played from time Min Value to Max Value. The sampling method is specified by "Sample Depth" and "Sample
  Rate".
  "Sample Rate" is the number of sample function values taken each second. Allowable values are 8000, 11025, 16000,
  22050, or 44100
  "Sample Depth" is the data size of a sample in bits. Allowable values are 8 and 16.

PlaySound( <Note>, <Duration>, <Instrument> ) (GeoGebra Classic 5 only)::
  Plays a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI[MIDI] note.
  _Note_ is an integer from 0 to 127 that represents a musical note given by the table below. When note = 60 a Middle C
  is played.
  _Duration_ is the time to play the note in seconds.
  _Instrument_ is an integer that represents the synthesized instrument used to play the note. See
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI#Program_change_events[technical
  specifications] for possible instruments.
  Most instruments are supported, but there are differences between computer platforms.
