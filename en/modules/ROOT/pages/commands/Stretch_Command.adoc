= Stretch Command

Stretch( <xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[Object]>, <Vector> )::
  The object is stretched *parallel* to the given vector by the ratio given by the *magnitude* of the vector (i.e.
  points on the line perpendicular to the vector (through its startpoint) stay on their place and distance of other
  points from the line is multiplied by given ratio.)

Stretch( <xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[Object]>, <Line>, <Ratio> )::
  The object is stretched *perpendicular* to the line by the given ratio (i.e. points on the line aren't moved and the
  distance of other points from the line is multiplied by given ratio.)
