= CorrelationCoefficient Command

CorrelationCoefficient( <List of x-coordinates>, <List of y-coordinates> )::
  Calculates the product moment correlation coefficient using the given _x_- and _y_-coordinates.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`CorrelationCoefficient({1, 3, 2, 1, 5, 2}, {1, 6, 4, 3, 3, 2})` yields _0.36_.

====

CorrelationCoefficient( <List of Points> )::
  Calculates the product moment correlation coefficient using the coordinates of the given points.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`CorrelationCoefficient({(1, 1), (3, 6), (2, 4), (1, 3), (5, 3), (2, 2)})` yields _0.36_.
