== CAS Syntax

CFactor( <Expression> )::
  Factorizes a given expression, allowing for complex factors.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++CFactor(x^2 + 4)++` yields _(x + 2 ί) (x - 2 ί)_, the factorization of _x^2^ + 4_.

====

CFactor( <Expression>, <Variable> )::
  Factorizes an expression with respect to a given variable, allowing for complex factors.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++CFactor(a^2 + x^2, a)++` yields _(ί x + a) (- ί x + a)_, the factorization of _a^2^ + x^2^_ with respect to _a_.
* `++CFactor(a^2 + x^2, x)++` yields _(x + ί a) (x - ί a)_, the factorization of _a^2^ + x^2^_ with respect to _x_.
