[NOTE]
====

The _Execute_ command works only if the *commands in the list are written in English (US)*, regardless the language chosen for your GeoGebra interface. 

====

Execute( <List of Texts> )::
  Executes a list of commands entered as texts.


[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Execute({"A=(1,1)","B=(3,3)","C = Midpoint(A, B)"})++` creates points _A, B_ and their midpoint _C_.
* `++Execute(Join({"f_{1} = 1", "f_{2} = 1"}, Sequence("f_{"+(i + 2) + "} = f_{" + (i+1) + "} + f_{"+ i +"}", i, 1, 10)))++`
creates the first 10 elements of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence[Fibonacci sequence].

====

Execute( <List of Texts>, <Parameter>, ... , <Parameter> )::
  Use the placeholders %1, %2 and so on as arguments of the commands in the list. The placeholders will be respectively replaced with the parameters used in the _Execute_ command. Up to 9 parameters can be specified. After the replacement, the resulting scripts will be executed.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Execute({"Segment(%1,%2)","Midpoint(%1,%2)"}, A, B)++` creates the segment _AB_ and its midpoint.

[NOTE]
====

If the quote symbol (`++"++`) is not available in your keyboard, use the virtual keyboard of GeoGebra or the command `++UnicodeToLetter(34)++`
