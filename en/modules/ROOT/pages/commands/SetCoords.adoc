SetCoords( <Object>, <x>, <y> )::
  Sets the cartesian coordinates of xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[free] objects in a 2D View as the given coordinates. This command uses
  the coordinates values, not their definitions, therefore the object stays free.

SetCoords( <Object>, <x>, <y>, <z> )::
  Sets the cartesian coordinates of xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[free] objects in the 3D View as the given coordinates. This command uses
  the coordinates values, not their definitions, therefore the object stays free.

[NOTE]
====

* This also works for points on paths and in regions. The point will be moved to the closest possible position.

* This command works also for sliders, buttons, checkboxes, input Boxes and Images. 

* If the option "Absolute Screen Position" is selected, then _x_, _y_ and _z_ are in screen pixels.
