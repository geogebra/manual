RotateText( <Text>, <Angle> )::
  Creates a new xref:/LaTeX.adoc[LaTeX] text, rotated by the given angle.

[NOTE]
====

* The text needs to be enclosed in double quotes `++"++`.
* The text is rotated around the top left corner (also known as Corner 4) of the box containing it, and placed at the origin of the coordinate system.
* The default setting for the angle is radians. Use the degree symbol `++째++` for rotation angles measured in degrees.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++RotateText("a = 5", 45째)++`

* If you want to place the text "GeoGebra", rotated by 42째, at point (6,6), use the command `++Text(RotateText("GeoGebra", 42째), (6, 6),true,true)++`
