TTest( <List of Sample Data>, <Hypothesized Mean>, <Tail> )::
  Performs a one-sample t-test of a population mean using the given list of sample data. _Hypothesized Mean_ is the
  population mean assumed in the null hypothesis. _Tail_ has possible values "<", ">" , "≠". These specify the
  alternative hypothesis as follows.
  "<" = population mean < _Hypothesized Mean_
  ">" = population mean > _Hypothesized Mean_
  "≠" = population mean ≠ _Hypothesized Mean_

Results are returned in list form as _\{Probability value, t-test statistic}_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++TTest({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 3, "<")++` yields _\{0.5, 0}_.

====

TTest( <Sample Mean>, <Sample Standard Deviation>, <Sample Size>, <Hypothesized Mean>, <Tail> )::
  Performs a one-sample t-test of a population mean using the given sample statistics. _Hypothesized Mean_ and _Tail_
  are defined as above. Results are returned in list form as _\{Probability value, t-test statistic}_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++TTest(4, 1, 12, 4, "≠")++` yields _\{1, 0}_.
