InverseChiSquared( <Degrees of Freedom>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution[Chi
  squared distribution] at probability _p_, where the Chi squared distribution is defined by the given _degrees of freedom_.
  In other words, it finds _t_ such that _P(X â‰¤ t) = p_, where _X_ is a Chi squared random variable.
  Probability _p_ must be a value in the closed interval [0,1].
