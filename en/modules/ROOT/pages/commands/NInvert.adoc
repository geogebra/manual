NInvert( <Function> )::
Gives the inverse of the function without showing the inverted formula.
If you want to get the formula, use the xref:./Invert.adoc[Invert Command] instead.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++NInvert(sin(x))++` yields a function _f_ such that _sin(f(x))=x_ for _-1 < x < 1_.

====

[NOTE]
====

* No account is taken of domain or range, for example for f(x) = x^2^ or f(x) =
sin(x).

* The command works faster for functions that only contain one _x_.
To make your construction more efficient you may want to rearrange your functions and use eg `NInvert((x+1)^2-1)` rather than `NInvert(x^2+2x)`.
