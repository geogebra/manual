Cube( <Square> )::
  Creates a cube having as base the given square.

Cube( <Point>, <Point>, <Direction> )::
  Creates a cube having the segment between the two points as an edge.
  The other vertices are uniquely determined by the given direction, that should be one of:
  * a vector, a segment, a line, a ray *orthogonal* to the segment, or
  * a polygon, a plane *parallel* to the segment.
+  
The created cube will have:
  * a face with the segment as an edge in a plane orthogonal to the given vector/segment/line/ray, or
  * a face with the segment as an edge in a plane parallel to the polygon/plane.

Cube( <Point>, <Point>, <Point>)::
  Creates a cube with three (adjacent) points of the first face. The points have to start a square for the cube to be
  defined.

Cube( <Point>, <Point>)::
  Creates a cube with two (adjacent) points of the first face, and the third point automatically created on a circle, so
  that the cube can rotate around its first edge.

[NOTE]
====

Cube(A, B) is a shortcut for Cube(A, B, C) with C = Point(Circle(B, Distance(A, B), Segment(A, B))).
