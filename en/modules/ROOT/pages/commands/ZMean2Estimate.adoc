ZMean2Estimate( <List of Sample Data 1>, <List of Sample Data 2>, <σ1>, <σ2>, <Confidence Level> )::
  Calculates a _Z_ confidence interval estimate of the difference between two population means using the given sample data
  sets, population standard deviations and _confidence level_.
  Results are returned in list form as {lower confidence limit, upper confidence limit}.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Two sample data `++list1 = {1, 4, 5, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2}++`, `++list2 = {2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 2, 4}++` are given. The standard
deviation of list1 is `++σ_1 = sqrt(2)++`, the standard deviation of list2 is `++σ_2  = sqrt(1.75)++` and the confidence
level is 0.75. `++ZMean2Estimate(list1, list2, σ_1,  σ_2, 0.75)++` yields _list3 = {-0.29, 1.29}_.

ZMean2Estimate( <Sample Mean 1>, <σ1>, <Sample Size 1>, <Sample Mean 2 >, <σ2>, <Sample Size 2>, <Confidence Level>)::
  Calculates a _Z_ confidence interval estimate of the difference between two population means using the given sample
  means, population standard deviations and _confidence level_.
  Results are returned in list form as {lower confidence limit, upper confidence limit}.
