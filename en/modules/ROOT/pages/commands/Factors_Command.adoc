= Factors Command

Factors( <Polynomial> )::
  Gives a list of lists of the type _\{factor, exponent}_ such that the product of all these factors raised to the power
  of the corresponding exponents equals the given polynomial. The factors are sorted by degree in ascending order.
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

`Factors(x^8 - 1)` yields _\{\{x - 1, 1}, \{x + 1, 1}, \{x^2 + 1, 1}, \{x^4 + 1, 1}}_.

====

[NOTE]

====

Not all of the factors are irreducible over the reals.

====

Factors( <Number> )::
  Gives matrix of the type stem:[\left( \begin\{array}\{} prime_1 & exponent_1 \\ prime_2 & exponent_2 \\prime_3 &
  exponent_3 \\ \end\{array} \right) ] such that the product of all these primes raised to the power of the
  corresponding _exponents_ equals the given number. The primes are sorted in ascending order.

[EXAMPLE]

====

* `Factors(1024)` yields _( 2 10 )_, since stem:[1024 = 2^\{10}].
* `Factors(42)` yields stem:[\left( \begin\{array}\{} 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 1 \\7 & 1 \\ \end\{array} \right) ], since stem:[42 =
2^1・3^1・7^1].

variables can be used as input and the results are returned as proper matrices.

[EXAMPLE]

====

`Factors(a^8 - 1)` yields stem:[\left( \begin\{array}\{} a - 1 & 1 \\ a +1 & 1 \\a^2 + 1& 1 \\a^4 + 1& 1 \\ \end\{array}
\right)].
