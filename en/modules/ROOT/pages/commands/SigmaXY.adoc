= SigmaXY Command

SigmaXY( <List of Points> )::
  Calculates the sum of the products of the _x_- and _y_-coordinates.

[EXAMPLE]
====

You can work out the covariance of a list of points using `++SigmaXY(list)/Length(list) - MeanX(list) * MeanY(list)++`.

====

SigmaXY( <List of x-coordinates>, <List of y-coordinates> )::
  Calculates the sum of the products of the _x_- and _y_-coordinates.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let `++A = (-3, 4)++`, `++B = (-1, 4)++`, `++C = (-2, 3)++` and `++D = (1, 3)++` be points.
`++{x(A), x(B), x(C), x(D)}++` yields the x-coordinates of the points in a list _list1 = \{-3, -1, -2, 1}_ and
`++{y(A), y(B), y(C), y(D)}++` yields the y-coordinates of the points in a list _list2 = \{4, 4, 3, 3}_. Command
`++SigmaXY(list1, list2)++` yields _a = -19_.
