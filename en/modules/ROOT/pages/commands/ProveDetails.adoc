ProveDetails( <Boolean Expression> )::
  Returns some details of the result of the automated proof.

Normally, GeoGebra decides whether a xref:/Boolean_values.adoc[boolean expression] is true or not by using numerical
computations. However, the ProveDetails command uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_computation[symbolic methods]
to determine whether a statement is true or false in general. This command works like the
xref:/commands/Prove.adoc[Prove] command, but also returns some details of the result as a xref:/Lists.adoc[list]:

* An empty list *{}* if GeoGebra cannot determine the answer.
* A list with one element: *{false}*, if the statement is not true in general.
* A list with one element: *{true}*, if the statement is always true (in all cases when the diagram can be
constructed).
* A list with more elements, containing the boolean value _true_ and another list for some so-called _non-degeneracy
conditions_, if the statement is true under certain conditions, e.g. {true, {"AreCollinear(A,B,C),AreEqual(C,D)"}}.
This means that if none of the conditions are true (and the diagram can be constructed), then the statement will be
true.
* A list *{true,{"..."}}*, if the statement is true under certain conditions, but these conditions cannot be
translated to human readable form for some reasons.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let us define a triangle with vertices _A_, _B_ and _C_, and define `++D=MidPoint(B,C)++`, `++E=MidPoint(A,C)++`,
`++p=Line(A,B)++`, `++q=Line(D,E)++`. Now `++ProveDetails(pâˆ¥q)++` returns {true}, which means that if the diagram can
be constructed, then the midline _DE_ of the triangle is parallel to the side _AB_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let _AB_ be the segment _a_, and define `++C=MidPoint(A,B)++`, `++b=PerpendicularBisector(A,B)++`,
`++D=Intersect(a,b)++`. Now `++ProveDetails(C==D)++` returns {true,{"AreEqual(A,B)"}}: it means that if the points _A_
and _B_ differ, then the points _C_ and _D_ will coincide.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let _AB_ be the segment _a_, and define `++l=Line(A,B)++`. Let _C_ be an arbitrary point on line _l_, moreover let
`++b=Segment(B,C)++`, `++c=Segment(A,C)++`. Now `++ProveDetails(a==b+c)++` returns {true,{"a+b==c", "b==a+c"}}: it
means that if neither stem:[a+b=c], nor stem:[b=a+c], then stem:[a=b+c].

====

It is possible that the list of the non-degeneracy conditions is not the simplest possible set. For the above example,
the simplest set would be the empty set.
