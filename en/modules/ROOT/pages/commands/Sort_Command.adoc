= Sort Command

Sort( <List> )::
  Sorts a list of numbers, text objects, or points.
  +

[EXAMPLE]
====

*Examples:*

* `Sort({3, 2, 1})` gives you the list _\{1, 2, 3}_.
* `Sort({"pears", "apples", "figs"})` gives you the list elements in alphabetical order.
* `Sort({(3, 2), (2, 5), (4, 1)}) ` gives you _\{(2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 1)}_.

====

[NOTE]
====

Lists of points are sorted by _x_-coordinates.

====

Sort( <Values>, <Keys> )::
  Sorts the first list _Values_ according to the corresponding second list _Keys_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

*Examples:*

* In order to sort a list of polynomials `list1 = {x^3, x^2, x^6}` according to degree, create the dependent list of
degrees `list2 = Zip(Degree(a), a, list1)`. After that, ` Sort(list1, list2)` yields the requested _list3 = \{x^2, x^3,
x^6}_.
* In order to draw the polygon having as vertices the complex roots of stem:[x^\{10}-1], sorted by their arguments,
create `list1 = {ComplexRoot(x^10-1)}`, then use the command `Polygon(Sort(list1, arg(list1)))`. This command yields
_poly1 = 2.94_.
