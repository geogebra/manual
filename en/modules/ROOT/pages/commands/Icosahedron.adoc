Icosahedron( <Equilateral Triangle> )::
  Creates an icosahedron having as base the given equilateral triangle.

Icosahedron( <Point>, <Point>, <Direction> )::
  Creates an icosahedron having the segment between the two points as an edge.
  The other vertices are univocally determined by the given direction, that needs to be:
  * a vector, a segment, a line, a ray *orthogonal* to the segment, or
  * a polygon, a plane *parallel* to the segment.
+
The created icosahedron will have:
  * a face with the segment as an edge in a plane orthogonal to the given vector/segment/line/ray, or
  * a face with the segment as an edge in a plane parallel to the polygon/plane.

Icosahedron( <Point>, <Point>, <Point>)::
  Creates an icosahedron with the three points of the first face. The points have to draw an equilateral triangle for
  the icosahedron to be defined.

Icosahedron( <Point>, <Point>)::
  Creates an icosahedron with the two points of the first face, and the third point automatically created on a circle,
  so that the icosahedron can rotate around its first edge.

[NOTE]
====

Icosahedron(A, B) is a shortcut for Icosahedron(A, B, C) with C = Point(Circle(Midpoint(A, B), Distance(A, B) sqrt(3) /
2, Segment(A, B))).
