TrapezoidalSum( <Function>, <Start x-Value>, <End x-Value>, <Number of Trapezoids> )::
  Calculates the trapezoidal sum of the function in the interval [_Start x-Value, End x-Value_] using _n_ trapezoids.

This command draws the trapezoids of the trapezoidal sum as well.
* This command is designed as a visual aid so won't give accurate answers if the number of rectangles is too large.
