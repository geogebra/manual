SolveODE( <f'(x, y)> )::
  Attempts to find the exact solution of the first order ordinary differential equation (ODE)
  stem:[\frac{dy}{dx}(x)=f'(x, y(x))].

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++SolveODE(2x / y)++` yields _stem:[\sqrt{2} \sqrt{-c_{1}+x^{2}}]_, where stem:[c_{1}] is a constant.

====

[NOTE]
====

stem:[c_{1}] will be created as an auxiliary object with a corresponding slider.

====

SolveODE( <f'(x, y)>, <Point on f> )::

Attempts to find the exact solution of the first order ODE stem:[\frac{dy}{dx}(x)=f'(x, y(x))] and returns the solution
through the given point (Cauchy problem).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++SolveODE(y / x, (1, 2))++` yields _y = 2x_.

====



SolveODE( <f'(x, y)>, <Start x>, <Start y>, <End x>, <Step> )::
  Solves first order ODE stem:[\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x, y)] numerically with given start point, end and step for _x_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++SolveODE(-x*y, x(A), y(A), 5, 0.1)++` solves stem:[\frac{dy}{dx}=-xy] using previously defined _A_ as a starting
point.

====

[NOTE]
====

* xref:/commands/Length.adoc[Length]( <Locus> ) allows you to find out how many points are in the computed locus.
* xref:/commands/First.adoc[First]( <Locus>, <Number> ) allows you to extract the points as a list.
* To find the "reverse" solution, just enter a negative value for _End x_, for example
`++SolveODE(-x*y, x(A), y(A), -5, 0.1)++`

====

SolveODE( <y'>, <x'>, <Start x>, <Start y>, <End t>, <Step> )::
  Solves first order ODE stem:[\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{f(x, y)}{g(x, y)}] with given start point, maximal value of an
  internal parameter _t_ and step for _t_. This version of the command may work where the first one fails e.g. when the
  solution curve has vertical points.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++SolveODE(-x, y, x(A), y(A), 5, 0.1)++` solves stem:[\frac{dy}{dx}=- \frac{x}{y} ] using previously defined _A_ as
a starting point.

====

[NOTE]
====

To find the "reverse" solution, just enter a negative value for _End t_, for example
`++SolveODE(-x, y, x(A), y(A), -5, 0.1)++`.

====

SolveODE( <b(x)>, <c(x)>, <f(x)>, <Start x>, <Start y>, <Start y'>, <End x>, <Step> )::

Solves second order ODE stem:[y'' + b(x) y' + c(x) y = f(x)].

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++SolveODE(x^2, 2x, 2x^2 + x, x(A), y(A), 0, 5, 0.1)++` solves the second order ODE using previously defined _A_ as a
starting point.

====



[NOTE]
====

Always returns the result as locus. The algorithms are currently based on
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge-Kutta_methods[Runge-Kutta numeric methods].

== CAS Syntax

SolveODE( <Equation> )::
  Attempts to find the exact solution of the first or second order ODE. For first and second derivative of _y_ you can
  use _y'_ and _y''_ respectively.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++SolveODE(y' = y / x)++` yields _y = c~1~ x_.

====

SolveODE( <Equation>, <Point(s) on f> )::
  Attempts to find the exact solution of the given first or second order ODE which goes through the given point or list of points.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++SolveODE(y' = y / x, (1, 2))++` yields _y = 2x_.

====

SolveODE( <Equation>, <Point(s) on f>, <Point(s) on f'> )::
  Attempts to find the exact solution of the given first or second order ODE and goes through the given _point (or list of points) on f_
  and _f'_ goes through the given _point (or list of points) on f'_ .

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++SolveODE(y'' - 3y' + 2 = x, (2, 3), (1, 2))++` yields stem:[ y = \frac{-9 x^2 e^3 + 30 x e^3 - 32 {(e^3)}^2 + 138
e^3 + 32 e^{3 x} }{54 e^3} ].

====

SolveODE( <Equation>, <Dependent Variable>, <Independent Variable>, <Point(s) on f> )::
  Attempts to find the exact solution of the given first or second order ODE which goes through the given point (or list of points).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++SolveODE(v' = v / w, v,  w, (1, 2))++` yields _v = 2w_.

====

SolveODE( <Equation>, <Dependent Variable>, <Independent Variable>, <Point(s) on f>, <Point(s) on f'> )::
  Attempts to find the exact solution of the given first or second order ODE which goes through the given _point (or list of points) on
  f_ and _f'_ goes through the given _point (or list of points) on f'_ .

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++SolveODE(v' = v / w, v,  w, (1, 2), (0, 2))++` yields _v = 2w_.

====

[NOTE]
====

For compatibility with input bar, if the first parameter is just an expression without _y'_ or _y''_, it is supposed to
be right hand side of ODE with left hand side _y'_.
