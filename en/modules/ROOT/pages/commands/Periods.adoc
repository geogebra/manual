Periods( <Rate>, <Payment>, <Present Value>, <Future Value (optional)>, <Type (optional)> )::
  Returns the number of periods for an annuity based on periodic, fixed payments and a fixed interest rate.

* *<Rate>* Interest rate per period.
* *<Payment>* The amount paid in each period.
* *<Present Value>* Total amount that a series of future payments is worth now.
* *<Future Value (optional)>* A cash balance you want to attain after the last payment. If you do not enter a future
value, it is assumed to be 0.
* *<Type (optional)>* Indicates when payments are due. If you do not enter a value or you enter 0 the payment is due at
the end of the period. If you enter 1 it is due at the beginning of the period.

`++Periods(10%/12, -200, -400, 10000, 1)++` yields a number of payments of 39.7.
