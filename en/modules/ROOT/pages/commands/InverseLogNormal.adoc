InverseLogNormal( <Mean>, <Standard Deviation>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of the
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution[log-normal distribution] at probability _p_, where the log-normal
  distribution is given by mean _μ_ and standard devation _σ_.
  In other words, it finds _t_ such that _P(X ≤ t) = p_, where _X_ is a log-normal random variable.
  Probability _p_ must be from [_0, 1_].

*Examples:*

* `++InverseLogNormal(10, 20, 1/3)++` computes _3.997_.
* `++InverseLogNormal(1000, 2, 1)++` computes stem:[ \infty ].
