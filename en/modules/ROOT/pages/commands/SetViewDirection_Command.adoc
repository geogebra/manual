SetViewDirection( <Direction> )::
  Sets the direction of the 3D view orientation depending on the given object.

[EXAMPLE]

====

`SetViewDirection(Vector((0, 0, 1)))`

====

[EXAMPLE]

====

`SetViewDirection((0, 0, 1))`

====

[EXAMPLE]

====

`SetViewDirection(x + y + z = 1)`

====

SetViewDirection( )::
  Sets the direction of the 3D view orientation to the default position.
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

`SetViewDirection()`

====

SetViewDirection( <Direction>, <Boolean animated> )::
  Sets the direction of the 3D view orientation depending on the given object, with optional animation.
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

In order to obtain the rotation of the 3D view, depending on the values of a previously created slider _α_, use the
command `SetViewDirection(Vector((1; α; -30°)), false)` in the _OnUpdate_ scripting tab of slider _α_.

====

[NOTE]

====

*Notes:*

* The view direction can be set towards a line, segment, plane, etc.
* If you do eg `SetViewDirection(x + y + z = 1)` twice then there are two possible outcomes and the _second_ one will
rotate the view 180°. To avoid ambiguity use eg `SetViewDirection(Vector((0, 0, 1)))`
