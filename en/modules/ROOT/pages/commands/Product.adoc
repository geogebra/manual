= Product Command

Product( <List of Raw Data> )::
  Calculates the product of all numbers in the list.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Product({2, 5, 8})++` yields _80_.

====

Product( <List of Numbers>, <Number of Elements> )::
  Calculates the product of the first _n_ elements in the list.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Product({1, 2, 3, 4}, 3)++` yields _6_.

====

Product( <List of Numbers>, <List of Frequencies> )::
  Calculates the product of all elements in the _list of numbers_ raised to the value given in the _list of frequencies_
  for each one of them.

[EXAMPLE]
====

*Examples:* `++Product({20, 40, 50, 60}, {4, 3, 2, 1})++` yields
__1536000000000000__`++Product({sqrt(2), cbrt(3), sqrt(5), cbrt(-7)}, {4, 3, 2, 3})++` yields _-420_

====

[NOTE]
====

The two lists must have the same length.

====

== CAS Syntax

Product( <List of Expressions> )::
  Calculates the product of all elements in the list.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Product({1, 2, x})++` yields _2x_.

====

Product( <Expression>, <Variable>, <Start Index>, <End Index> )::
  Calculates the product of the expressions that are obtained by replacing the given variable with every integer from
  _start_ to _end_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Product(x + 1,  x,  2, 3)++` yields _12_.
