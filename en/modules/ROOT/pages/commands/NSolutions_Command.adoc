= NSolutions Command

The following commands are only available in the image:16px-Menu_view_cas.svg.png[Menu view cas.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/CAS_View.adoc[CAS View].

NSolutions( <Equation> )::
  Attempts (numerically) to find a solution for the equation for the main variable. For non-polynomials you should
  always specify a starting value (see below)
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

`NSolutions(x^6 - 2x + 1 = 0)` yields _\{0.51, 1}_ or _\{0.508660391642, 1}_ (the number of decimals depends on the
choosen in xref:/Options_Menu.adoc[global rounding])

====

NSolutions( <Equation>, <Variable> )::
  Attempts (numerically) to find a solution of the equation for the given unknown variable. For non-polynomials you
  should always specify a starting value (see below)
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

`NSolutions(a^4 + 34a^3 = 34, a)` yields _\{a = -34.00086498588374, a = 0.9904738885574178}_.

====

NSolutions( <Equation>, <Variable = starting value> )::
  Finds numerically the list of solutions to the given equation for the given unknown variable with its starting value.
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Examples:*

* `NSolutions(cos(x) = x, x = 0)` yields _\{0.74}_
* `NSolutions(a^4 + 34a^3 = 34, a = 3)` yields the list _\{0.99}_.

====

NSolutions( <List of Equations>, <List of Variables> )::
  Attempts (numerically) to find a solution of the set of equations for the given set of unknown variables.
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

`NSolutions({pi / x = cos(x - 2y), 2 y - pi = sin(x)}, {x = 3, y = 1.5})` yields the list _\{3.14, 1.57}_

====

[NOTE]

====

* If you don't give a starting point like _a=3_ or _\{x = 3, y = 1.5}_ the numerical algorithm may find it hard to find
a solution (and giving a starting point doesn't guarantee that a solution will be found)
* The number of decimals depends on the choosen in xref:/Options_Menu.adoc[global rounding].
* NSolutions won't work for functions that are asymptotic to the x-axis. They can often be reformulated though.
* NSolutions will work only if the function is continuous
* See also xref:/commands/Solutions_Command.adoc[Solutions Command] and xref:/commands/NSolve_Command.adoc[NSolve
Command].
