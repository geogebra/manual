InverseNormal( <Mean>, <Standard Deviation>, <Probability> )::
  Evaluates the expression stem:[\Phi^{-1}(P) \cdot \sigma + \mu ] at given probability _P_, where stem:[\Phi^{-1}] is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function _Î¦_ for _N(0,1)_, defined by the given parameters _mean_ and _standard deviation_.

[NOTE]
====

Returns the _x_-coordinate of the point with the given probability (area) to the left, under the normal distribution curve.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++InverseNormal(50, 2, 0.9)++` yields 52.56, that is the 90th percentile of a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and standard deviation 4.5.
