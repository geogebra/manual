= BoxPlot Command

BoxPlot( yOffset, yScale, List of Raw Data )::
  Creates a box plot using the given raw data and whose vertical position in the coordinate system is controlled by
  variable _yOffset_ and whose height is influenced by factor _yScale_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++BoxPlot(0, 1, {2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9})++`

====

BoxPlot( yOffset, yScale, Start Value, Q1, Median, Q3, End Value )::
  Creates a box plot for the given statistical data in interval (_Start Value, End Value_).
BoxPlot( <yOffset>, <yScale>, <List of Raw Data>, <Boolean Outliers> )::
  This allows outliers to be plotted as "X"s rather than included in the boxplot. For this command,
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier[outliers] are data lying below _Q1 - 1.5 * (Q3 - Q1)_ or above _Q3 + 1.5 * (Q3 -
  Q1)_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQR[see IQR]).
BoxPlot( <yOffset>, <yScale>, <List of Data>, <List of Frequencies>, <Boolean Outliers> )::
  This allows data from a frequency table to be easily plotted as a boxplot.
