= FitExp Command

FitExp( <List of Points> )::
  Calculates the exponential regression curve in the form _aℯ^bx^_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++FitExp({(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3), (6, 4)})++` yields _1.31ℯ^0.21x^_.

[NOTE]
====

* If you want the answer in the form stem:[ a b ^ x ] then use the xref:/commands/FitGrowth.adoc[FitGrowth Command].
* You can do a direct least-squares fitting with `++Fit(list, a*exp(b*x))++`
* Euler's number ℯ can be obtained by pressing [.kcode]#ALT # + [.kcode]# e#.
