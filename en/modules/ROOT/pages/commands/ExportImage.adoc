[EXAMPLE]
====

*Examples:*

* `++ExportImage("scale", 5)++`

Shows a popup of the current view so that the user can right-click -> Save Image As...

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.png")++`

Saves a file called "image.png" of the current view

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.png", "view", 2)++`

Saves a file called "image.png" of Graphics View 2

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.png", "view", -1)++`

Saves a file called "image.png" of View 3D Graphics

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.png", "dpi", 300)++`

Saves a file called "image.png" of the current view at 300 dpi (dots-per-inch)

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.png", "scale", 2)++`

Saves a file called "image.png" of the current view at scale 2 (ie twice nominal screen resolution)

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.png", "scalecm", 2, "dpi", 600)++`

Saves a file called "image.png" of the current view at 600 dpi at a scale 1 unit = 2 cm

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.png", "width", 1000)++`

Saves a file called "image.png" of the current view with width = 1000 pixels

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.png", "height", 1000)++`

Saves a file called "image.png" of the current view with height = 1000 pixels

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.png", "transparent", true)++`

Saves a transparent PNG file called "image.png"

Setting the “transparent” property as _false_ saves also background images.

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.svg", "type", "svg")++`

Saves a file called "image.svg" of the current view in SVG format

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.gif", "type", "gif", "slider", a, "loop", true, "time", 200, "width", 400)++`

Saves a looping animated GIF of the current view controlled by slider "a" with 200ms between frames. *Keep the width and
number of slider steps small*

* `++ExportImage("filename", "image.gif", "type", "gif", "view", -1, "rotate", 360°, "slider", a, "loop", true, "time", 200)++`

Saves a looping animated GIF of the current view controlled by slider "a" with 200ms between frames and rotates the view
360° during the animation. *Keep the size of the view and the number of steps small*

* `++ExportImage("type", "pdf", "filename", "test.pdf")++`

Creates a PDF of the current view (or a 2-page PDF if Graphics View 2 is open)

* `++ExportImage("type", "pdf", "filename", "test.pdf", "slider", n)++`

Creates a *multi-page* PDF of the current view where each page corresponds to one step of the slider "n"

* `++pic1 = ExportImage("view", 2, "corner", A, "corner2", B)++`

Creates a GeoGebra image of View 2 and puts it in the view with position defined by `++A++` and `++B++`

[NOTE]
====

*Notes:*

* In GeoGebra Classic 5 if there is no `++filename++` parameter the image will be copied to the Clipboard. In the Chrome
browser you can specify `++"clipboard", true++`
* To crop an export, make the Points `++Export_1++` and `++Export_2++` to define the rectangle to crop (*These also crop
the exports from the menus eg File -> Export Image*)
* Some syntaxes aren't supported in GeoGebra 5 Classic
* In Chrome, you can try the experimental syntax `++"type", "webm"++` to get a faster & smaller export than with
animated GIFs
* For the 2D Graphics Views you can try this syntax to get a monochrome export `++"grayscale", true++` (PNG format only)
* For the 3D Graphics View, only bitmaps (eg png, gif) are supported. In GeoGebra Classic 5 you can try this to get a
high-resolution output
`++ExportImage("filename", "c:\Users\<username>\AppData\image.png", "view", -1, "width", 2000)++`. Change *<username>*
to your Windows username
