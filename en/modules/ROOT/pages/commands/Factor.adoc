* Factorise (UK)
* Factorise (Aus)   

|===

Factor( <Polynomial> )::
  Factors the polynomial.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Factor(x^2 + x - 6)++` yields _(x - 2) (x + 3)_.

[NOTE]
====

This command needs to load the Computer Algebra System, so can be slow on some computers.

== CAS Syntax

In the image:16px-Menu_view_cas.svg.png[Menu view cas.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/CAS_View.adoc[CAS View] you can also
use the following syntax:

Factor( <Number> )::
  Expresses a number in its prime factorization

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Factor(360)++` yields _2³ 3² 5_.

====

Factor( <Expression>, <Variable> )::
  Factors an expression with respect to a given variable.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Factor(x^2 - y^2, x)++` yields _(x - y) (x + y)_, the factorization of _x^2^ - y^2^_ with respect to _x_,
* `++Factor(x^2 - y^2, y)++` yields _-(y - x) (y + x)_, the factorization of _x^2^ - y^2^_ with respect to _y_.

[NOTE]

This command factors expressions over the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number[Rational Numbers]. To factor over
irrational real numbers, see the xref:/commands/IFactor.adoc[IFactor Command]. To factor over complex numbers, see the
xref:/commands/CFactor.adoc[CFactor Command] and xref:/commands/CIFactor.adoc[CIFactor Command].
