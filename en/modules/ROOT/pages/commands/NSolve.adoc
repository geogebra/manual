NSolve( <Equation> )::
  Attempts (numerically) to find a solution for the equation for the main variable. For non-polynomials you should
  always specify a starting value (see below).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++NSolve(x^6 - 2x + 1 = 0)++` yields _{x = 0.51, x = 1}_.

NSolve( <Equation>, <Variable> )::
  Attempts (numerically) to find a solution of the equation for the given unknown variable. For non-polynomials you
  should always specify a starting value (see below).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++NSolve(a^4 + 34a^3 = 34, a)++` yields _{a = -34, a = 0.99}_.

====

NSolve( <Equation>, <Variable = starting value> )::
  Finds numerically the list of solutions to the given equation for the given unknown variable with its starting value.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++NSolve(cos(x) = x, x = 0)++` yields _{x = 0.74}_
* `++NSolve(a^4 + 34a^3 = 34, a = 3)++` yields _{a = 0.99}_.

====

NSolve( <List of Equations>, <List of Variables> )::
  Attempts (numerically) to find a solution of the set of equations for the given set of unknown variables.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++NSolve({pi / x = cos(x - 2y), 2 y - pi = sin(x)}, {x = 3, y = 1.5})++` yields _{x = 3.14, y = 1.57}_.

====

[NOTE]
====

* If you don't give a starting point like _a=3_ or _{x = 3, y = 1.5}_ the numerical algorithm may find it hard to find
a solution (and giving a starting point doesn't guarantee that a solution will be found)
* The number of decimals depends on the choosen in xref:/Options_Menu.adoc[global rounding].
* NSolve won't work for functions that are asymptotic to the x-axis or other extreme examples. They can often be
reformulated though.
* NSolve will work only if the function is continuous!
* See also xref:/commands/Solve.adoc[Solve Command] and xref:/commands/NSolutions.adoc[NSolutions Command].
