= KeepIf Command

KeepIf( <Condition>, <List> )::
  Creates a new list that only contains those elements of the initial list that fulfil the condition.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++KeepIf(x<3, {1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6})++` returns the new list _\{1, 2, 1}_.

====

[NOTE]
====

For list of numbers arbitrary condition may be used. For list of other objects one can use only conditions of the form
`++x==constant++` or `++x!=constant++`.

====

KeepIf( <Condition>, <Variable>, <List> )::
  This syntax allows a more flexible condition.

[EXAMPLE]
====

For Points _P, Q, R_ `++KeepIf(x(A) < 3, A, {P, Q, R})++` will filter the points whose _x_-coordinate is less than _3_
out of the list. The variable _A_ is replaced in turn with _P_ then _Q_ then _R_ for the check.
