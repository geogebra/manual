IntegralBetween( <Function>, <Function>, <Number>, <Number> )::
  Gives the definite integral of the difference _f(x) ‐ g(x)_ of two function _f_ and _g_ over the interval _[a, b]_,
  where _a_ is the first number and _b_ the second, with respect to the main variable.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++IntegralBetween(sin(x), cos(x), 0, pi)++` yields 2.

====

[NOTE]
====

This command also shades the area between the function graphs of _f_ and _g_.

====

IntegralBetween( <Function>, <Function>, <Number>, <Number>, <Boolean Evaluate> )::

Gives the definite integral of the difference _f(x) ‐ g(x)_ of two function _f_ and _g_ over the interval _[a, b]_,
where _a_ is the first number and _b_ the second, with respect to the main variable and shadows the related area if
_Evaluate_ is _true_. In case _Evaluate_ is _false_ the related area is shaded but the integral value is not calculated.

IntegralBetween( <Function>, <Function>, <Number>, <Number> )::
  Gives the definite integral of the difference _f(x) ‐ g(x)_ of two function _f_ and _g_ over the interval _[a, b]_,
  where _a_ is the first number and _b_ the second, with respect to the main variable.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++IntegralBetween(sin(x), cos(x), pi / 4, pi * 5 / 4)++` yields stem:[2 \sqrt{2}].

====

IntegralBetween( <Function>, <Function>, <Variable>, <Number>, <Number> )::
  Gives the definite integral of a variable of the difference _f(x) ‐ g(x)_ of two function _f_ and _g_ over the
  interval _[a, b]_, where _a_ is the first number and _b_ the second, with respect to the given variable.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++IntegralBetween(a * sin(t), a * cos(t), t, pi / 4, pi * 5 / 4)++` yields stem:[2 \sqrt{2} a].
