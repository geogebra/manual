= BinomialDist Command

BinomialDist( <Number of Trials>, <Probability of Success> )::
  Returns a bar graph of a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution[Binomial distribution].
  +
  The parameter _Number of Trials_ specifies the number of independent Bernoulli trials and the parameter _Probability
  of Success_ specifies the probability of success in one trial.
  +
BinomialDist( <Number of Trials>, <Probability of Success>, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
  Returns a bar graph of a Binomial distribution when _Cumulative_ = false.
  +
  Returns a graph of a cumulative Binomial distribution when _Cumulative_ = true.
  +
  First two parameters are same as above.
BinomialDist( <Number of Trials>, <Probability of Success>, <Variable Value>, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
  Let X be a Binomial random variable and let v be the variable value.
  +
  Returns P( X = _v_) when _Cumulative_ = false.
  +
  Returns P( X ≤ _v_) when _Cumulative_ = true.
  +
  First two parameters are same as above.

[NOTE]

====

*Note:* A simplified syntax is available to calculate P(_u_ ≤ X ≤ _v_): e.g. `BinomialDist(10, 0.2, 1..3)` yields
_0.77175_, that is the same as BinomialDist(10, 0.2, \{1, 2, 3}). This syntax also works in the CAS View

*Note:* *BinomialDist( <Number of Trials>, <Probability of Success>,<List of values>)* is also available.

  Let X be a Binomial random variable and let v be the variable value.

  Returns P( X = _v_) when _Cumulative_ = false.

*Example:*

You can plot a graph with eg `f(x):=BinomialDist(100,x,36,true)-BinomialDist(100,x,23,true)`

*Example:*

Assume transfering three packets of data over a faulty line. The chance an arbitrary packet transfered over this line
becomes corrupted is stem:[\frac\{1}\{10}], hence the propability of transfering an arbitrary packet successfully is
stem:[\frac\{9}\{10}].

* `BinomialDist(3, 0.9, 0, false)` yields _stem:[\frac\{1}\{1000}]_, the probability of none of the three packets being
transferred successfully.
* `BinomialDist(3, 0.9, 1, false)` yields _stem:[\frac\{27}\{1000}]_, the probability of exactly one of three packets
being transferred successfully.
* `BinomialDist(3, 0.9, 2, false)` yields _stem:[\frac\{243}\{1000}]_, the probability of exactly two of three packets
being transferred successfully.
* `BinomialDist(3, 0.9, 3, false)` yields _stem:[\frac\{729}\{1000}]_, the probability of all three packets being
transferred successfully.
* `BinomialDist(3, 0.9, 0, true)` yields _stem:[\frac\{1}\{1000}]_, the probability of none of the three packets being
transferred successfully.
* `BinomialDist(3, 0.9, 1, true)` yields _stem:[\frac\{7}\{250}]_, the probability of at most one of three packets being
transferred successfully.
* `BinomialDist(3, 0.9, 2, true)` yields _stem:[\frac\{271}\{1000}]_, the probability of at most two of three packets
being transferred successfully.
* `BinomialDist(3, 0.9, 3, true)` yields _1_, the probability of at most three of three packets being transferred
successfully.
* `BinomialDist(3, 0.9, 4, false)` yields _0_, the probability of exactly four of three packets being transferred
successfully.
* `BinomialDist(3, 0.9, 4, true)` yields _1_, the probability of at most four of three packets being transferred
successfully.
