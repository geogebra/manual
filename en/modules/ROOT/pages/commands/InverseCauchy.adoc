InverseCauchy( <Median>, <Scale>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution[Cauchy
  distribution] at probability _p_, where the Cauchy distribution is defined by parameters _median_ and _scale_.
  In other words, finds _t_ such that _P(X â‰¤ t) = p_, where _X_ is a Cauchy random variable.
  Probability _p_ must be a value in the closed interval [0,1].
