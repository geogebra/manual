Delete( <Object> )::
  Deletes the object and all its dependent objects.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let _P_ be a point, _sli_ a slider, and _seg=Segment(P, sli)_. The command `++Delete(sli)++` deletes the slider _sli_ and the segment _seg_, but doesn't delete point _P_ from the construction, since the point does not depend on the slider _sli_.

====
