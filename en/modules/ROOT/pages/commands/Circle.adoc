Circle( <Point>, <Radius Number> )::
  Yields a circle with given center and radius.
Circle( <Point>, <Segment> )::
  Yields a circle with given center and radius equal to the length of the given segment.
Circle( <Point>, <Point> )::
  Yields a circle with given center through a given point.
Circle( <Point>, <Point>, <Point> )::
  Yields a circle through the three given points (if they do not lie on the same line).

====

Circle( <Line>, <Point> )::
  Creates a circle with line as axis and through the point.
Circle( <Point>, <Radius>, <Direction> )::
  Creates a circle with center, radius, and axis parallel to direction, which can be a line, vector or plane.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Circle( <Point>, <Radius>, <Plane> )++` yields a circle parallel to the plane and with perpendicular vector of the
plane as axis.

====

Circle( <Point>, <Point>, <Direction> )::
  Creates a circle with center, through a point, and axis parallel to direction.

[NOTE]
====

If you use eg `++x = 0++` or `++y = 0++` for the _Direction_ it will be interpreted as a plane, not a line
