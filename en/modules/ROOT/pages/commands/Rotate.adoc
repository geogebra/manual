Rotate( <Object>, <Angle> )::

Rotates the xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[geometric object] by the angle around the axis origin.

Rotate( <Object>, <Angle>, <Point> )::

Rotates the geometric object by the angle around the given point.

Rotate( <Object>, <Angle>, <Axis of Rotation>)::

Rotates the geometric object by the angle around the given axis of rotation.

Rotate( <Object>, <Angle>, <Point on Axis>, <Axis Direction or Plane> )::

Rotates the geometric object by the angle around the axis defined by the given point and the axis direction or plane.

[NOTE]
====

* Vectors are not rotated around axis origin, but around their initial point.
* When a polygon, segment, arc, etc. is rotated, also images of the vertices / endpoints and sides (in case of polygon)
are created.
* This command also rotates images.
* For text rotation use xref:/commands/RotateText.adoc[RotateText Command].
