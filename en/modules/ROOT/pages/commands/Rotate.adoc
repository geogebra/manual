[NOTE]
====

* Vectors are not rotated around axis origin, but around their initial point.
* When a polygon, segment, arc, etc. is rotated, also images of the vertices / endpoints and sides (in case of polygon)
are created.
* This command also rotates images.
* For text rotation use xref:/commands/RotateText.adoc[RotateText Command].
