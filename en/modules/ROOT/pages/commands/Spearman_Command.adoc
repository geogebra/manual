= Spearman Command

Spearman( <List of Points> )::
  Returns http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient[Spearman's rank correlation
  coefficient] of x-coordinates and y-coordinates of points of a list.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let `++list = {(-3, 4), (-1, 4), (-2, 3), (1, 3), (2, 2), (1, 5)}++` be a list of points. `++Spearman(list)++` yields _a
= -0.37_.

====

Spearman( <List of Numbers>, <List of Numbers> )::
  Returns Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of two lists.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let `++list1 = {3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 6, 8, 9}++` and `++list2 = {5, 6, 8, 2, 1, 3, 4, 7}++` be two lists.
`++Spearman(list1, list2)++` yields _a = 0.24_.
