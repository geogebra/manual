InverseWeibull( <Shape>, <Scale>, <Probability> )::
  Evaluates the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution[Weibull
  distribution] at given _p_, where the Weibull distribution is defined by the given parameters _shape_ and _scale_. In other
  words, it finds _t_ such that _P(X ≤ t) = p_, where _X_ is a random variable with Weibull distribution. Probability _p_
  must be a value in the closed interval [0,1].
