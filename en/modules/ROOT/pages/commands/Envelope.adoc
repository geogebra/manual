Envelope( <Path>, <Point> )::
  Creates the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(mathematics)[envelope] equation of a set of output paths while the
  moving point is bound to another object.

An envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family of the output paths at some point.

[EXAMPLE]
====

http://www.geogebra.org/student/m67909[A ladder is leaning against the wall and sliding down.]

The contour of its trace will be the envelope of the ladder. Strictly speaking, GeoGebra computes the envelope of the
entire line containing the ladder as a segment. Only such envelopes can be computed where the appropriate construction
leads to an algebraic equation system.
