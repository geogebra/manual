Zip( <Expression>, <Var1>, <List1>, <Var2>, <List2>, ...)::
  Creates xref:/Lists.adoc[list] of objects obtained by substitution of variables in the expression by elements of
  corresponding lists. If the number of variables matches the number of lists, each variable is taken from the following
  list. If the number of variables exceeds number of lists by one, the last variable takes values from 1, 2, 3, ..., _k_
  where _k_ is the length of the shortest list. Length of the resulting list is minimum of lengths of input lists.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let P, Q, R, S be some points. `++Zip(Midpoint(A, B), A, {P, Q}, B, {R, S})++` returns a list containing
xref:/commands/Midpoint.adoc[midpoints] of segments _PR_ and _QS_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let _list1={x^2, x^3, x^6}_ be a list of polynomials. `++Zip(Degree(a), a, list1)++` returns the list _{2, 3, 6}_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let _list1={1, 2, 5}_ be a list of numbers. `++Zip(Simplify(a*x^(b-1)), a, list1,b)++` returns the list _{1, 2x,
5xÂ²}_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

Variables can also be functions: `++Zip(f(2), f, {x+1,x+3})++` returns the list _{3, 5}_.

====

[NOTE]
====

In each list the elements must be of the same type.
