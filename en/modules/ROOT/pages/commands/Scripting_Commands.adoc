These commands are substitutes for features accessible e.g. via
image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties Dialog] and
are meant to simplify xref:/Scripting.adoc[scripting] in GeoGebra.

[NOTE]
====

These commands don't return any object, therefore cannot be nested in other commands.
