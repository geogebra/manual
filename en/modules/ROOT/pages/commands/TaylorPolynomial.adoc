TaylorPolynomial( <Function>, <x-Value>, <Order Number> )::
  Creates the Taylor series expansion of the given function at the point _x-Value_ up to the given order.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++TaylorPolynomial(x^2, 3, 1)++` gives _9 + 6 (x - 3)_, the Taylor series expansion of _x^2^_ at _x = 3_ up to order _1_.

== CAS Syntax

TaylorPolynomial( <Expression>, <x-Value>, <Order Number> )::
  Creates the Taylor series expansion of the given expression at the point _x-Value_ up to the given order.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++TaylorPolynomial(x^2, a, 1)++` gives _a^2^ + 2a (x - a)_, the Taylor series expansion of _x^2^_ at _x = a_ up to order
_1_.

====

TaylorPolynomial( <Expression>, <Variable>, <Variable Value>, <Order Number> )::
  Creates the Taylor series expansion of the given expression with respect to the given variable at the point _Variable
  Value_ up to the given order.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++TaylorPolynomial(x^3 sin(y), x, 3, 2)++` gives _27 sin(y) + 27 sin(y) (x - 3) + 9 sin(y) (x - 3)^2^_, the Taylor 
series expansion with respect to _x_ of _x^3^ sin(y)_ at _x = 3_ up to order _2_.
* `++TaylorPolynomial(x^3 sin(y), y, 3, 2)++` gives _x^3^ sin(3) + x^3^ cos(3) (y - 3) - x^3^ stem:[\frac{sin(3) }{2}]
(y - 3)^2^_, the Taylor series expansion with respect to _y_ of _x^3^ sin(y)_ at _y = 3_ up to order _2_.

[NOTE]
====

The order has got to be an integer greater or equal to zero.
