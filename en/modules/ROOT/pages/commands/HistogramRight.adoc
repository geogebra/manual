HistogramRight( <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Heights> )::
  Same as 
  `++(Histogram(<List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Heights>)++`.

HistogramRight( <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Boolean Use Density> , <Density Scale Factor> (optional) )::
  Same as
  `++Histogram(<List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Boolean Use Density>, <Density Scale Factor>)++`, except
  that if a datum is equal to the right border of a class, it is counted in this class and not in the next one.

HistogramRight( <Boolean Cumulative>, <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Boolean Use Density> , <Density Scale Factor> (optional) )::
  Same as
  `++Histogram(<Boolean Cumulative>, <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Boolean Use Density>, <Density Scale Factor>)++`,
  except that if a datum is equal to the right border of a class, it is counted in this class and not in the next one.

[NOTE]
====

By convention this uses the a < x ≤ b rule for each class except for the first class which is a ≤ x ≤ b
