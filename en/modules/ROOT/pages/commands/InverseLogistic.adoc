InverseLogistic( <Mean>, <Scale>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of a
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_distribution[Logistic distribution] at probability _p_, where the Logistic
  distribution is defined by the given parameters _mean_ and _scale_.
  In other words, it finds _t_ such that _P(X ≤ t) = p_, where _X_ is a Logistic random variable.
  Probability _p_ must be a value in the closed interval [0,1].

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++InverseLogistic(100, 2, 1)++` yields _stem:[ \infty ]_.
