ChiSquared( <Degrees of Freedom>, <Variable Value> )::
  Calculates the value of the cumulative distribution function of a Chi squared distribution at _variable value_ _v_, i.e. the
  probability _P(X â‰¤ v)_ where _X_ is a random variable with a Chi squared distribution with the given _degrees of freedom_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++ChiSquared(4, 3)++` yields stem:[\gamma\left(2, \frac{3}{2}\right)], which is approximately _0.44_.

====

[NOTE]
====

This syntax returns the probability at a given _x_-coordinate's value, that is the area under the Chi squared distribution curve to the left of the given _x_-coordinate.

ChiSquared( <Degrees of Freedom>, <Variable Value>, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
  If _Cumulative = true_, calculates the value of the cumulative distribution function of a Chi squared distribution with given _degrees of freedom_ at the given _variable value_, otherwise it calculates the probability density function of the distribution at _variable value_.

ChiSquared( <Degrees of Freedom>, x, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
  If _Cumulative = true_, creates the cumulative density function (cdf) of a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution[Chi squared
  distribution] with the given degrees of freedom, othewise it creates the probability density function (pdf) of the distribution.
