[NOTE]
====

Commands *Solve* and xref:/commands/Solutions.adoc[Solutions] solve an equation or a system of equations over the real
numbers symbolically. To solve equations numerically, use the xref:/commands/NSolve.adoc[NSolve Command]. For solving
equations in complex numbers see xref:/commands/CSolve.adoc[CSolve Command].

====



Solve( <Equation in x> )::
  Solves a given equation for the main variable and returns a list of all solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Solve(x^2 = 4x)++` yields _{x = 4, x = 0}_, the solutions of _x^2^ = 4x_.

== CAS Syntax

The following commands are only available in the image:16px-Menu_view_cas.svg.png[Menu view cas.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/CAS_View.adoc[CAS View].

Solve( <Equation>, <Variable> )::
  Solves an equation for a given unknown variable and returns a list of all solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Solve(x * a^2 = 4a, a)++` yields {stem:[a = \frac{4}{x}, a = 0]}.

====

Solve( <Equation in x>, <Assumption> )::
  Solves an equation x, conditional on the assumption

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Solve(x^2=1, x>0)++` yields stem:[{x = 1}]

====

Solve( <List of Equations>, <List of Variables> )::
  Solves a set of equations for a given set of unknown variables and returns a list of all solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Solve({x = 4 x + y , y + x = 2}, {x, y})++` yields _( x = -1, y = 3 )_
* `++Solve({2a^2 + 5a + 3 = b, a + b = 3}, {a, b})++` yields _{{a = 0, b = 3}, {a = -3, b = 6}}_.

====

Solve( <Equation>, <Variable> , <List of assumptions>)::
  Solves an equation for a given unknown variable with the list of assumptions and returns a list of all solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Solve(u *x < a,x, u>0)++` yields _{x < a / u}_, the solution of _u *x < a_ assuming that _u>0_
* `++Solve(u *x < a,x, {u<0, a<0})++` yields _{x > a / u}_.

====

Solve( <List of Parametric Equations>, <List of Variables> )::
  Solves a set of parametric equations for a given set of unknown variables and returns a list of all solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Solve({(x, y) = (3, 2) + t*(5, 1), (x, y) = (4, 1) + s*(1, -1)}, {x, y, t, s})++` yields _{{x = 3, y = 2, t = 0,
s = -1}}_.

====

[NOTE]
====

* The right hand side of equations (in any of the above syntaxes) can be omitted. If the right hand side is missing, it
is treated as 0.
* Sometimes you need to do some manipulation to allow the automatic solver to work, for example
`++ Solve(TrigExpand(sin(5/4 π + x) - cos(x - 3/4 π) = sqrt(6) * cos(x) - sqrt(2)))++`.
* For piecewise-defined functions, you will need to use xref:/commands/NSolve.adoc[NSolve]
