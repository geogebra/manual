  Calculates the greatest common divisor of the two polynomials.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++GCD(x^2 + 4 x + 4, x^2 - x - 6)++` yields _x + 2_.

====

GCD( <List of Polynomials> )::
  Calculates the greatest common divisor of the list of polynomials.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++GCD({x^2 + 4 x + 4, x^2 - x - 6, x^3 - 4 x^2 - 3 x + 18})++` yields _x + 2_.
