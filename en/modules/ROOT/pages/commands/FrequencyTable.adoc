FrequencyTable( <List of Raw Data> )::
  Returns a table (as text) whose first column contains sorted list of unique elements of list _L_ and second column
  contains the count of the occurrences of value in the first column. List _L_ can be numbers or text.

FrequencyTable( <Boolean Cumulative>, <List of Raw Data> )::
  If _Cumulative = false_, returns the same table as Frequency( <List of Raw Data> )
  If _Cumulative = true_, returns a table whose first column is the same as in FrequencyTable( <List of Raw Data> ) and
  the second contains cumulative frequencies of values in the first column.

FrequencyTable( <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data> )::
  Returns a table (as text) whose first column contains intervals (classes) and second column contains the count of
  numbers in _List of Raw Data_, which belong to the interval in the first column. All intervals except the highest
  interval are of the form [a, b). The highest interval has the form [a, b].

FrequencyTable( <Boolean Cumulative>, <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data> )::
  If _Cumulative = false_, returns the same table as FrequencyTable( <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data> )
  If _Cumulative = true_, returns a table whose first column is the same as in FrequencyTable( <List of Raw Data> ) and
  the second contains cumulative frequencies of values in the first column.

FrequencyTable( <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Use Density> , <Density Scale Factor (optional)> )::
  Returns a table (as text) whose first column contains intervals (classes) and second contains frequencies for the
  corresponding xref:/commands/Histogram.adoc[Histogram Command].

FrequencyTable( <Boolean Cumulative>, <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Use Density> , <Density Scale Factor (optional)> )::
  Returns a table (as text) whose first column contains intervals (classes) and second contains frequencies for the
  corresponding xref:/commands/Histogram.adoc[Histogram Command].

FrequencyTable( <List of Raw Data>,<Scale Factor (optional)> )::
  Returns a table (as text) whose first column *Value* contains a sorted list of unique elements of the _<List of Raw
  Data>_ and second column *Frequency* contains the count of the occurrences of value in the first column multiplied by
  the _<Scale Factor>_. The list can be numbers or text.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++FrequencyTable({"red", "red", "green", "green", "blue"}, 5)++` returns a table with first column _Value_ with entries
blue, green, red (alphabetical order) and second column _Frequency_ with entries 5, 10, 10.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++FrequencyTable({1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5}, 2)++` returns a table with first column _Value_ with entries 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 and second column _Frequency_ with entries 6, 4, 4, 2, 2.

====

[NOTE]
====

In the list there appears 1 three-times, so the count of the occurences of 1 (=3) has to be multiplied by the scale
factor 2 to get entry 6 in the second column.

[NOTE]

This command is similar to xref:/commands/Frequency.adoc[Frequency Command] and xref:/commands/Histogram.adoc[Histogram
Command]. Articles about these commands contain some related examples.
