RunClickScript( <Object> )::
  Runs the click script associated with the Object (if it has one).

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let _A_ and _B_ be points. The _OnClick_ script for _B_ is `++SetValue(B,(1,1))++`. Setting the _OnClick_ script of _A_
as `++RunClickScript(B)++`, moves point _B_ to (1,1) when point _A_ is clicked.
