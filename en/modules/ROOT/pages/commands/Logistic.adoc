Logistic( <Mean>, <Scale>, <Variable Value> )::
  Evaluates the cumulative distribution function of a logistic distribution at variable value _v_, i.e. calculates the
  probability _P(X â‰¤ v)_ where _X_ is a random variable with a logistic distribution defined by the given parameters _mean_ and _scale_.

[NOTE]
====

This syntax returns the probability at a given value, that is the area under the Erlang distribution curve to the left of the given _x_-coordinate.

Logistic( <Mean>, <Scale>, <Variable Value>, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
 If _Cumulative = true_, evaluates the cumulative distribution function of a logistic distribution with given _mean_ and _scale_ at the given _variable value_, otherwise it evaluates the probability density function of the distribution at _variable value_.

Logistic( <Mean>, <Scale>, x, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
 If _Cumulative = true_, creates the cumulative density function (cdf) of a logistic distribution with given _mean_ and _scale_, otherwise it creates the probability density function (pdf) of the distribution.
