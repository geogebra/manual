= LCM Command

UK English: LCM = lowest common multiple

LCM( <Number>, <Number> )::
  Calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++LCM(12, 15)++` yields _60_.

====

LCM( <List of Numbers> )::
  Calculates the least common multiple of the elements in the list.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++LCM({12, 30, 18})++` yields _180_.

LCM( <Polynomial>, <Polynomial> )::
  Calculates the least common multiple of the two polynomials.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++LCM(x^2 + 4 x + 4, x^2 - x - 6)++` yields stem:[x^3 + x^2 - 8 x - 12].

====

LCM( <List of Polynomials> )::
  Calculates the least common multiple of the polynomials in the list.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++LCM({x^2 + 4 x + 4, x^2 - x - 6, x^3 - 4 x^2 - 3 x + 18})++` yields stem:[x^4 - 2 x^3 - 11 x^2 + 12 x + 36].
