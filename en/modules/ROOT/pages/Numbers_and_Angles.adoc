== Numbers

You can create numbers by using the xref:/Input_Bar.adoc[Input Bar]. If you only type in a number (e.g. 3), GeoGebra
assigns a lower case letter as the name of the number. If you want to give your number a specific name, you can type in
the name followed by an equal sign and the number (e.g. create a decimal r by typing in r = 5.32).

[NOTE]
====

In GeoGebra, numbers and angles use a period (.) as a decimal point.

====

You can also use the constant π and the Euler constant e for expressions and calculations by selecting them from the
drop down list next to the _Input Bar_ or by using xref:/Keyboard_Shortcuts.adoc[Keyboard Shortcuts].

[NOTE]
====

If the variable e is not used as a name of an existing object yet, GeoGebra will recognize it as the Euler constant if
you use it in new expressions.

====

== Angles

Angles can be entered in degrees (°) or radians (rad). The constant π is useful for radian values, and can also be
entered as _pi_.

[NOTE]
====

You can enter a degree symbol (°) or the pi symbol (π) by using the following keyboard shortcuts:

* [.kcode]#Alt# + [.kcode]#O# (Mac OS: [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#O#) for the degree symbol °
* [.kcode]#Alt# + [.kcode]#P# (Mac OS: [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#P#) for the pi symbol π

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

* Angle α in degree `++α = 60°++`, or using the Degrees/Minutes/Seconds syntax: `++α =1°23′45''++`
* Angle α in radians `++α = pi/3 ++`.

====

[NOTE]
====

GeoGebra does all internal calculations in radians. The degree symbol (°) is nothing but the constant π/180 used to
convert degree into radians.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

* If a = 30 is a number, then α = a° converts number a to an angle α = 30°, without changing its value.
* If you type in b = α / °, the angle α is converted back to the number b = 30, without changing its value.

====

[NOTE]
====

For dependent angles you can specify whether they may become reflex or not on tab _Basic_ of the
xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties Dialog].

== Free Numbers and Angles

xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[Free] numbers and angles can be displayed as sliders in the
image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View]
(see image:24px-Mode_slider.svg.png[Mode slider.svg,width=24,height=24] xref:/tools/Slider.adoc[Slider Tool]). Using the
arrow keys, you may change the value of numbers and angles in the image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view
algebra.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Algebra_View.adoc[Algebra View] too (see xref:/Animation.adoc[Manual Animation]
section).

=== Limit Value to Interval

Free numbers and angles may be limited to an interval [min, max] by using tab _Slider_ of the
image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties Dialog]
(see also image:24px-Mode_slider.svg.png[Mode slider.svg,width=24,height=24] xref:/tools/Slider.adoc[Slider Tool]).
