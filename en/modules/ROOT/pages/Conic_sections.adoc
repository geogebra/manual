= Conic sections

You may enter a conic section as a quadratic equation in x and y. Prior defined variables (e.g. numbers, points,
vectors) can be used within the conic’s equation.

[NOTE]

====

*Note:* The conic section’s name can be entered at the beginning of the input, followed by a colon.

[NOTE]

====

*Note:* If you define two parameters _a = 4_ and _b = 3_ in advance, you may enter for example an ellipse as
`ell: b^2 x^2 + a^2 y^2 = a^2 b^2`.
