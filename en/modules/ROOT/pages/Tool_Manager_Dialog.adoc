[NOTE]
====

Tools management is fully functional only in Classic v.5.

====

In the 
image:18px-Menu-tools.svg.png[Menu-tools.svg,width=18,height=18] xref:/Tools_Menu.adoc[Tools Menu], select
image:18px-Menu-tools.svg.png[Menu-tools.svg,width=18,height=18] _Manage Tools_ to open a panel containing 
the list of the custom tools currently available in the construction, editable info about their main properties 
(related command name, help, and icon), and the following management options:

* *Delete:* +
 Select a tool from the list and press Delete to remove the selected tool from the construction.

* *Open:* +
 Select a tool from the list and press Open to open the tool in a separate GeoGebra window. The tool can be modified and saved such that changes are automatically applied to the construction.


[NOTE]
====

After modifying the tool, select image:18px-Menu-tools-new.svg.png[Menu-tools-new.svg,width=18,height=18] _Create new tool_ 
in image:18px-Menu-tools.svg.png[Menu-tools.svg,width=18,height=18] xref:/Tools_Menu.adoc[Tools Menu] to save it. 
Keeping the same name results in overwriting the existing tool, while giving it a new name saves it as a new tool.
To overwrite a tool that is already in use, the types of input and output objects must remain the same.

====

* *Save as… :* +
Select a tool from the list and press Save as… to save the tool on the computer as a .ggt file. This file can be opened in other constructions.

[NOTE]
====

Use the xref:/Toolbar.adoc[toolbar] customization options to add a loaded tool to the toolbar.
