= Export Graphics Dialog

[NOTE]
====

The following only applies to *GeoGebra Classic 5*. For newer versions please see the
xref:/commands/ExportImage_Command.adoc[ExportImage()] command

====

This dialog is accessible via the _Export_ submenu of xref:/File_Menu.adoc[File Menu] (item
image:Image-x-generic.png[Image-x-generic.png,width=16,height=16] Graphics View as Picture (png, eps)….)

Keyboard shortcut: [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#Shift# + [.kcode]#U# (Mac OS: [.kcode]#Cmd# + [.kcode]#Shift# +
[.kcode]#U#)

This dialog allows you to save GeoGebra's image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View] as a picture file on your computer. In the
appearing dialog window, you can select the picture file _Format_, change the _Scale_ (in cm) and _Resolution_ (in dpi)
of the picture, and set the image as _Transparent_.

[NOTE]
====

If you create points called _Export_1_ and _Export_2_ then these will define the rectangle that is exported, otherwise
just the visible image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_ is
exported

====

When exporting the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_ as a
picture you can choose out of the following formats:

PNG – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics[Portable Network Graphics]::
  This is a pixel graphics format. The higher the resolution (dpi), the better the quality (300dpi will usually
  suffice). PNG graphics should not be scaled subsequently to avoid a loss of quality.
  +
  PNG graphic files are well suited for the use on web pages (HTML) and in word processing documents.

[NOTE]
====

Whenever you insert a PNG graphic file into a word processing document (menu Insert, Image from file) make sure that the
size is set to 100 %. Otherwise the given scale (in cm) would be changed.

====

EPS – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulated_Postscript[Encapsulated Postscript]::
  This is a vector graphics format. EPS pictures may be scaled without loss of quality. EPS graphic files are well
  suited for the use with vector graphics programs (e.g. Corel Draw) and professional text processing systems (e.g.
  xref:/LaTeX.adoc[LaTeX]).
  +
  The resolution of an EPS graphic is always 72dpi. This value is only used to calculate the true size of an image in
  centimeters and has no effect on the image's quality.

[NOTE]
====

The transparency effect with filled polygons or conic sections is not possible with EPS. Objects can only be either 100%
opaque or transparent.

====

PDF – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format[Portable Document Format]::
  (see EPS format above)

[NOTE]
====

In SVG and PDF export you have the option to export text as editable text or shapes. This stores the text either as text
(this lets you edit the text in e.g. InkScape) or as Bézier curves (this guarantees that the text looks the same even if
the correct font is not installed).

SVG – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphic[Scalable Vector Graphic]::
  (see EPS format above)

EMF – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile[Enhanced Metafile]::
  (see EPS format above)
