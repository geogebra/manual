GeoGebra supports real matrices, which are represented as a list of xref:/Lists.adoc[lists] that contain the rows of the
matrix.

[EXAMPLE]
====

In GeoGebra, `{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}` represents the 3x3 matrix stem:[\begin{pmatrix}1&2&3\\ 4&5&6\\ 7&8&9
\end{pmatrix}]

====

To display a matrix using LaTeX formatting in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View], use the xref:./commands/FormulaText.adoc[FormulaText]
command or drag and drop the matrix definition from _Algebra View_ to _Graphics View_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

In the xref:/Input_Bar.adoc[Input Bar] type `++FormulaText[{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}]++` to display the matrix
using LaTeX formatting.

====

== Accessing Elements of Matrices

To access particular elements of a matrix you can use the xref:/commands/Element.adoc[Element Command] or the simplified
syntax shown in the example below:

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let `++matrix={{1, 2}, {3, 4}}++`, then:

* `++matrix(1, 1) ++` returns the first element in the first line: _1_
* `++matrix(2, 2)++`, `++matrix(-1,2)++`, `++matrix(2,-1) ++` and `++matrix(-1,-1) ++` all return the second element of
the second line: _4_.
* In general, `++matrix(i, j) ++`, where _i_ and _j_ are integers, returns the element of the matrix that occupies the
_i-th_ row and the _j-th_ column.

====

== Matrix Operations

Matrix operations are _operations with lists_, so the following syntaxes produce the described results.

[NOTE]
====

Some syntaxes can represent operations which are not defined in the same way in the matrices set.

====

=== Addition and subtraction

* `++Matrix1 + Matrix2++`: adds the corresponding elements of two compatible matrices.
* `++Matrix1 â€“ Matrix2++`: subtracts the corresponding elements of two compatible matrices.

=== Multiplication and division

* `++Matrix * Number++`: multiplies each element of _Matrix_ by the given _Number_.
* `++Matrix1 * Matrix2++`: uses matrix multiplication to calculate the resulting matrix.

[EXAMPLE]
====

{{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}} * {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}} yields the matrix {{9, 12, 15}, {19, 26, 33}, {29, 40,
51}}.

====

[NOTE]
====

The rows of the first and columns of the second matrix need to have the same number of elements.

====

* `++2x2 Matrix * Point (or Vector)++`: multiplies the _Matrix_ by the given _Point / Vector_ and yields a point.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`{{1, 2}, {3, 4}} * (3, 4)` yields the point _A_ = (11, 25).

====

* `++3x3 Matrix * Point (or Vector)++`: multiplies the _Matrix_ by the given _Point / Vector_ and yields a point.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {0, 0, 1}} * (1, 2)` gives you the point A = (8, 20).

====

[NOTE]
====

This is a special case for affine transformations where homogeneous coordinates are used: (x, y, 1) for a point and (x,
y, 0) for a vector. This example is therefore equivalent to: `++{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {0, 0, 1}} * {1, 2, 1}++`.

====

* `++Matrix1 / Matrix2++`: Divides each element of _Matrix1_ by the corresponding element in _Matrix2_.

[NOTE]
====

However, GeoGebra supports the syntax `++Matrix1 * Matrix2 ^(-1)++` .

====

== Other operations

The section xref:/commands/Vector_and_Matrix_Commands.adoc[Matrix Commands] contains the list of all available commands related to
matrices, such as:

* xref:/commands/Determinant.adoc[Determinant][Matrix]: calculates the determinant for the given matrix.
* xref:/commands/Invert.adoc[Invert][Matrix]: inverts the given matrix
* xref:/commands/Transpose.adoc[Transpose][Matrix]: transposes the given matrix
* xref:/commands/ApplyMatrix.adoc[ApplyMatrix][Matrix,Object]: apply affine transform given by matrix on object.
* xref:/commands/ReducedRowEchelonForm.adoc[ReducedRowEchelonForm][Matrix]: converts the matrix to a reduced row-echelon
form
